a job opportunity came about and like nearly 50 of my high school class i moved to toronto at first i felt it was necessary to avoid actually living inside the city i did the commute i became frazzled then i decided that it wasnt so bad off and moved into the city best decision ever its in the small experiences the restaurants the bars the parks the festivals and small shops and public art each of those have some of the best in the world its about building a sense of neighbourhood each neighbourhood has a culture and very different challenges diversity brings us together more as a city and the boredom and stress of commuting allows us to be more creative as a whole we hunted for capybaras put a coat on a monkey and held a funeral for a raccoon i wouldnt give up this city at all mnorthcott emigrated to toronto almost 40 years ago  it was a bit boring then but not any longer in the late 70s you couldnt find a pub or restaurant open on a sunday every year it gets better the downtown growth is fantastic and makes for a lively and fun street scene in the past seven days ive been to luminato the pride parade toronto fringe and the toronto jazz festival what i like best is the diversity among the people who live here and the easy tolerance you find on the street at work in the schools annie m the pride parade in toronto much of what is great about the city is accidental northtorontoguy ive lived all over canada and toronto is very disconnected its spread out and no one really knows each other its one giant anonymous village shatford shatford i have lived in toronto for 30 years after emigrating from england i can honestly say i regard it as the best place in the world in which to live and have never regretted for an instant moving here the saying goes that toronto is a city built in a forest look out over the city from the cn tower and you will be struck by just how many trees cover the landscape the city has an urban forestry department kapple wards island toronto a proud torontonian i often think the perfect city would be a cross between toronto and montreal where i resided for five years in the 90s unfortunately torontos tremendous growth has come at a cost an overdeveloped and poorly planned waterfront overpriced housing and strains on public transit jim bachalo the reason you see every building so clearly from the water is because toronto planners in their wisdom allowed developers to build right up to the waters edge therefore cutting off access to the lakefront for toronto citizens suriasioh i remember well how in the 1950s we montrealers used to quip that the best thing in toronto is the road to montreal johnraphael toronto skyline i worked in toronto in 1960 the city was by far the dullest i have ever stepped foot in it contained not one single establishment like a pub or bar where one could go for a drink you wanted alcohol youd need to buy it at a government package store and take it home before you opened the bottle judihoskyn885 ive lived here for 20 years and love the city but it is unadventurous in spirit while there is plenty of creativity it seems to happen in spite of toronto being what it is this conservatism in a cultural sense is deeply rooted in the history of the city which used to force its shops to close curtains on sundays to keep people from window shopping shavik places are only as interesting as the people that live there and a utopia like toronto only seems to bring out a mildlypleasant ennui in everyone its prozac in city form that said id love to go live there again 9cupsoftea  jennifer dickie jenniferdickie july 5 2016 sunrise in torontos port lands industry  nature coexist in this former river delta we row here guardiancanada pictwittercombf8xzty0uu montreal a city broken by the 1976 olympics most people and i mean 95 think that montreals decline and torontos ascent began in 1976 with the election of the pq the truth is that toronto was destined to overtake montreal as canadas financial centre anyhow the referendum narrative is a bit an urban myth that states that it all started with the rise of quebec nationalism the exodus of english quebecers and head offices out of montreal the seeds of the demise started decades earlier quebec nationalism and the exodus just accelerated that demise everything that montreal has dealt with since 1976  lower immigration and foreign investment than toronto  is a consequence of the acceleration caused by the separatists montreals shift from global city to a frenchcanadian city was one of those things that happened even before people knew it happened according to jane jacobs toronto is canadas premiere city and one country cant have two premiere cities benbaxter many professional sports venues in north america and elsewhere are in far more remote and carcentric locations than the olympic stadium which is located close to two mtro stations and not really very far from anywhere in central montral i live in the district where jarry park is located and the last thing we would want is a megastadium destroying a beloved park in a workingclass area in centralnorthern montral weve had enough problems with the tennis not that im against sport but this is a vital green lung for people in a densely populated area of the city lagatta calgary a city trying to beat urban sprawl i was born and raised in calgary and calgarys urban sprawl is outrageous they are making a tiny bit of headway with urban density but not much and definitely are not leading the way in any shape or form maybe a couple of people have declared war on urban sprawl but tell that to all the developers and people buying gigantic houses in brand new suburbs that are growing at an astounding rate the only thing that has slowed down urban sprawl is the drop in oil prices violettecharlie vancouver foreign investment and the real estate bubble foreign investment is a difficult topic for canadians to talk about because all of our families came from somewhere else  except for the first nations peoples in vancouver we need to remember that hong kong money coming into the city helped us weather a recession fairly well however there is no denying that buying a home within metro vancouver is outside the grasp of a majority of middle class people and this has to change if we respect diversity of all types in our city rental properties are dwindling the pay for citizenship scheme for immigration does not work for the community if it is the source cause of the ridiculously high priced housing market i rent in the west end of vancouver i want to stay here through to my retirement and after but i know even with a good income ill always be a renter brooke sherbrooke i live in burnaby a multiethnic suburb next to vancouver bc my area is known as korea town thanks to various asian markets nearby and a healthy korean demographic and when locals get together and chat while standing in line to pay for groceries what have you it doesnt matter what race you are  the lament around here is universal no one born in metro vancouver can afford to be here now unless they can live with family or were lucky enough to score a place and secure an older lease and if youve got kids  be they korean chinese white filipino southamerican westindies etc  theyre totally screwed they cant afford rent they were born here went to school here their parents have been paying taxes for decades etc and collectively contributed to why its nice to be in this area they helped build a sense of community you can find racism in metro vancouver but when people complain facetoface these days its coming from a more diverse demographic at least when i grumble while waiting for a skytrain the guy standing next me chinesecanadian nods and grumbles too and a woman from the dominican republic shares a story about slumlords buying her apartment building to tear it down and build a condo for the rich and the guy from iran shakes his head in agreement while sharing hes packingup and moving to the north end of vancouver island burnaby boasts numerous parks a lake protected forests conservation area with hiking and biking trails along with salmon streams just 4 blocks away from where im sitting ive seen wild salmon spawning just 30 minutes outside downtown vancouver thats what its like to live here you can still raise a family take your kids to a park go for walks do things outside and if left unchecked greedy real estate developers and corrupt politicians will eventually turn my area  and metrovancouver  into a city as dense as hong kong janemarple facebook twitter pinterest property development in yaletown vancouver photograph alamy stock photo vancouver is actually very small in area and cannot grow except up housingland prices will always be high because of the demand from wealthy people across canada and the world a good reason for this is that vancouver is consistently rated among the best cities in the world to live currently third by the uks economist publication canadachuck developers in vancouver are clearly targeting ethnic chinese buyers ever notice the mandarinlanguage property development advertising at the vancouver airport yes unabated foreign investment is a problem  but so are the local entities fuelling it njrinvan a vancouverite here the unaffordability of housing here is a real and serious issue but please understand it is fundamentally different from the antiimmigrant crisis in uk europe or trumpnation canada has a relatively short history and everyones an immigrant here except for the aboriginal people of course  we dont have a single cohesive cultural or historical tradition to defend and multiculturalism itself has become the heart of the national identity the things that bind us together are not some cultural assimilation not much to assimilate to really except for hockey maybe but our constitution respect for one another and shared love and pride for this beautiful country and its diversity saleis its almost certainly true that foreign capital is affecting prices in vancouver but it seems wrong to entirely fail to acknowledge any other factors at all one vancouvers longstanding policy of densification quite a long time ago they looked at the trend of increasing population and realized it was fundamentally impossible for everyone who wanted to live in vancouver to live in a singlefamily unit north americanese for house usually detached or semidetached so they stopped building them its basically impossible that anyone will ever again get a permit to build a singlefamily unit in vancouver anywhere there wasnt already a singlefamily unit and the council looks favourably  by policy  on proposals to buy up singlefamily units knock em down and replace them with a more dense form of housing ie condos you could ban absolutely all foreign property ownership tomorrow and youd likely barely make a dent in the singlefamily unit market the pressures on it are just too strong adamwilliamson it is a complicated issue there should be hard data on how many shares in the market these rich chinese people are responsible for as a whole probably less than 5 canada bc in particular has a very racist history against the chinese people i totally agree there should be some sort of measures done by the government to cool down the market but its incorrect just to focus on the rich chinese people there are also rich americans or rich indians etc rich chinese made a difference but its not like they are responsible for the whole real estate market there and many canadians benefited from the rise in price of their houses or condos jason ma the demise of street hockey in canadian cities  mitchell reardon mitchellreardon july 5 2016 life brings life to publicspacestreet hockey bans are bad for kids  canada httpstcopqvizsduh2 freerangekids pictwittercomcpzsdwheaz i grew up in edmonton suburbs in the 60s early 70s  street hockey was a joy and in the winter played long after the sun went down and often endured frozen fingers fantastic fun yosserian arrived in edmonton in 57 from merseyside and immediately took to the streets with new friends played street hockey through to high school 66 where i live now bc other than organized sports the park and school grounds are empty i have seen a number of street hockey games around town though so all is not lost here yet banning street games is beyond brain dead hornbyislandeagle hell it was cold and icy enough in toronto when i lived there 1959 through 1962 that we even managed to play on skates from time to time got interesting when the road sloped away i miss seeing kids out and around playing pickup basketball baseball and jumping rope its become rare tightlines i certainly played street hockey in my childhood in toronto but it was only one of a handful of sports and games we played today i feel priviliged to live in a neighbourhood in st johns where my child can play outside knocking on nearby doors to round up friends and fill the streets with their screeches and yells the important part is that children are welcome and expected to play out on the sidewalks and corners and schoolyard in my neighbourhood tracy williamson the us and canada the ultimate sibling rivalry when president bill clinton addressed parliament our prime minister jean chretien said americans are our best friends whether we like it or not clinton doubled over laughing because he knew it was true if i could pick my neighbour it would still be the us over all other countries when i was on holidays in new orleans a shopkeeper asked where l came from i said canada she said i dont know where that is but i heard of it thats the way l like it pete wal from a womans perspective canada is the usas welleducated but poorer and dowdy older neighbour hes selling drugs on the internet and she works in a library she spends way too much time thinking about him id2463357 first nations and modern canada many first nation families want to live traditional values and culture in a modern way but even that can be a struggle thankfully things are changing and more resources are coming available however challenges to live first nation culture in todays world still exist for example in some areas in canada it is still impossible to get a traditional wedding as legally recognized as much as a mainstream wedding you basically need to have two weddings i have spoken to chief louie numerous times and he will relate the struggles hes had with government to make his community reflect his peoples modern goals i am a first nation person trying to live my culture in a modern fashion if canadians values have changed it is their responsibility to dismantle the legal chains applied by previous generations that is what i fight for i find cultures have a way of defining quality of life in a way that supports their culture canadians say they are multicultural but that only means as longs youre from a culture that supports the urban environment poverty is in the eye of the beholder ursaminor6 and other stories london ontario edmonton alberta basketball and edmonton dont seem compatible on the surface  one of canadas most northern capital cities isnt exactly known for its hoops prowess however with edmontons own adut bulgak making her wnba debut for the new york liberty recently edmonton basketball is starting to make an impact theres an organization called the nab northern alberta basketball that prides itself on being the northernmost elite basketball training theyre based in edmonton and work with kids of all ages that show promise to help them develop their skills they also provide the same training to kids that cant afford it  helping them out by keeping them focused on academics and basketball kyle muzyka via email the annual cultural heritage festival in edmonton has over the past three years had an estimated 360410000 people attending over the first weekend in august that is nearly half of the citys population of about 1 million the heritage weekend is the most public display of the many ethnic organizations but they are active yearround with smaller events what is particular to canada is that a preservation of ethnic identity can coexist with frictionfree mixing of different groups in workplaces school classes and public space in general the sense i get as a relatively recent immigrant is that there is no looking down on others there is no glass ceiling for what immigrants can become in professional life in fact a recent report shows that canada integrates immigrants in work life far better than for example sweden while different groups of immigrants live in unusual harmony and prosperity in canada a sore point is the situation of the original inhabitants while government policy is changing for the better scars have not healed and first nation groups are still living disadvantaged lives martin jagersand via email dave sutherland 04 july 2016 631pm edmonton unknown quantity preferred habitat a 1960s bungalow that was only just barely affordable and always just slightly too far from anywhere you actually want to go goto look business casual friday on mondays through thursdays shorts and tshirts on fridays sweatpants on weekends life creed trying to not be like the rest of alberta but not actually interested in separating either proudest achievement signing mcdavid even though had no personal involvement in that catchphrase no thats calgary moncton new brunswick i was born in montreal but lived and worked around the world before moving to moncton new brunswick 10 years ago to live in a more quiet place where nature is still very beautiful ten years later i am very happy with my move we are fortunate to have an excellent quality of life here no traffic little pollution kind and gentle people yet almost everything we need and an international airport crime is almost nonexistent and moncton is perhaps the most honest place i ever visited houses are still affordable and there is a lot of green space most of all i really love the proximity of the ocean and being able to reach the beach in less than an hour i feel fortunate to live in this place far from the dust and bustle of cramped overpopulated cities maryse courville via email thank you to everyone who
