industry and its replacement with lasses jobs led many people to vote to leave the european union a hartlepool clergyman has said graeme buttery spoke of voters rage and powerlessness in a debate on the eu referendum at the church of england synod which opened in york on friday people in the north east had voted to leave despite the injection of vast sums of money from the eu since we joined the european union the shipyards have sunk the coalmines have collapsed the steel works dare i mention it have rusted and the chemical works have dissolved the jobs that came were lasses jobs and even they didnt last because three or four years ago the phone calling company that had set up in hartlepool decided to downsize and move to india said buttery he added no number of grants from the european union can make that right anywhere near quickly justin welby the archbishop of canterbury said the outcome of the 23 june poll had been clear and whatever our view of what we would have preferred we must now deal with the world as it is but he added the campaign exposed deep divisions within our society and the result released a latent racism and xenophobia in all sectors and challenges the prevailing consensus of tolerance and acceptance the country was now facing a period of profound uncertainty he added the outbursts of the last two weeks may pass but the signal has been set at danger for our cohesion robert innes the brusselsbased bishop in europe said tears had been shed over the referendum result a few people are pleased with the result but many more are deeply upset people who had retired to spain or france were desperately worried he added these are ordinary working people who thought they could safely retire to a warmer place and they now fear becoming pawns in a complex negotiation about migration there was some veiled criticism raised in a written question which asked how well the church of england understands our nation given the publicly aired views of our leadership on brexit compared with the outcome of the referendum before the referendum welby came out in favour of the remain campaign along with a handful of bishops but synod delegates overwhelmingly backed a motion encouraging all members of the church to unite in the common task of building a generous and forwardlooking country more news topics christianity
