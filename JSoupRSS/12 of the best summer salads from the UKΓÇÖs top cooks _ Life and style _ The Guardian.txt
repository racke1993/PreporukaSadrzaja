hendersons warm salt cod little gem and tomato salad perhaps its to do with those delicate arctic summers but norwegian salt cod or klippfisk seems a little gentler in a salad than its portuguese and spanish counterparts the aoli here makes more than you need about 300ml in all but its not worth making in smaller quantities on the plus side it keeps very well for five or six days and can be used with all sorts from crudits to poached or roast fish chicken rabbit or quail serves four for the aoli 10 cloves garlic peeled sea salt and black pepper 1 freerange egg yolk at least 300ml extravirgin olive oil juice of 1 lemon you may not need it all but its best to have it to hand just in case for the salad 300g salt cod norwegian ideally skinned 6 good tomatoes sea salt and black pepper extravirgin olive oil 2 heads little gem leaves separated and washed 1 healthy spoonful aoli see above 1 handful chopped curly parsley first make the aoli put the garlic into the chopping bowl of a food processor with a pinch of salt this helps to break it up and a little pepper whizz until finely pulped  this is important because you dont want garlic chippings in your aoli with the motor still running add the egg yolk let it meet the garlic for a moment then carefully and slowly pour in the oil in a gentle stream the emulsion should safely hold up to 300ml of oil at this point take a view and if you can add a little more oil add the lemon juice tasting as you go adjust the seasoning and refrigerate soak the salt cod overnight in clean water or perhaps early in the morning before your dinner if you are using a lightly salted variety you should soak it for at least 12 hours and change the water a few times cut the tomatoes in half lengthways sprinkle with salt pepper and oil and roast in a medium oven for about 20 minutes this will soften and slightly dry them intensifying and sweetening their flavour leave to cool making sure to reserve the cooking juices put the little gem leaves and roast tomato halves in a bowl mix the oily tomato juices with a spoonful of aoli when youre ready to serve bring a pan of water to a gentle simmer chop the cod into 25cm cubes and poach in the simmering water for five minutes be gentle but dont worry unduly if the cod does fall apart slightly it will still taste delicious gently lift out the fish with a slotted spoon shake off any excess water and add to the salad bowl spoon over the tomatoaoli dressing add the parsley gently but thoroughly toss the salad and eat fergus henderson is chefpatron of st john in london what to drink
