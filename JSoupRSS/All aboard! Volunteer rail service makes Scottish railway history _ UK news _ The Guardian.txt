shed and only one of its three handbuilt carriages is fully glazed but for one week only the train from leadhills to glengonnar halt has become an essential addition to the uks rail network in a rare perhaps unique moment in british railway history a replacement train service has been put on to make up for a closed road it is normally the other way round and this service is run by amateurs launched 30 years ago by a small group of singleminded rail enthusiasts high on the barren rocky moors of southwest scotland the leadhills and wanlockhead railway lwr is ordinarily a weekendsonly summertime attraction for tourists then south lanarkshire council decided to resurface the only road connecting the two villages that vie for the title as scotlands highest the b797 was to be closed

train from glengonnar halt squeezing kaylas buggy into a narrow coach with wooden benches and no glass in the doors its a wow she said this is entirely different im used to your big super fast trains it is a short trip of just just more than half a mile 1km between the two stations with another 500metre walk from glengonnar the site of an old lead mine down a boggy disused railway cutting to wanlockhead itself its workhorse locomotive a stubby bluepainted dieselpowered engine called clyde rattles and judders over the single narrowgauge track at a stately five miles an hour it hits 8mph on its downhill run back to leadhills during the guardians visit the train was overtaken by a large heron leisurely flapping its way alongside facebook twitter pinterest children look out at workers relaying the b797 road from their lwr carriage photograph murdo macleod for the guardian with the only connecting road closed the alternative for anyone trying to reach either village is a brisk walk over the moors along rough tracks or a huge hourlong detour by car via sanquhar if youre a bit sickly its not much fun having to make a 50mile trip just to travel a mile said daren welch one of the lwr volunteers carrying several dozen passengers a day the service has helped ferry shopping and prescriptions from leadhills to wanlockhead on monday a courier company dropped off its parcels at leadhills for another driver to retrieve at the other end the lwr is run by volunteers drawn from across southern scotland and even in to cumbria welch runs a bookshop 20 miles away in moffat with his

only one of the carriages has glass in every window that is the carriage for wet and windy days its what we laughingly call first class because it has cushions in too from old glasgow trams said welch already known for producing the gold that made scotlands crown used in the coronation of james v in 1513 the villages have a secure place in scotlands social history lead miners in the two villages set up the first two subscription lending libraries in europe in 1741 in leadhills and 1756 in wanlockhead in tune with a strong tradition of selfhelp in southwest scotland  the village of fenwick 40

history the sciences and politics its oldest date to the mid1600s related strike rochdale from the record books the coop began in scotland dorothy wordsworth a poet and the sister of william wordsworth was reputedly stunned when shoeless children in wanlockhead spoke to her in latin and greek in 1803 during a tour of scotland with her brother and samuel coleridge the lwr has its own claims to exclusivity at 1500ft high it is the highest narrow gauge adhesion railway in the uk one which runs like standard trains simply from the friction of its wheels against the tracks rather than being pulled by cable the b797 is due to reopen this weekend the roadworks were completed faster than forecast and winpenny hopes the publicity and goodwill its voluntary services has brought could also help with one important but underreported campaign the lwr is trying to persuade the areas landowner the duke of buccleuch to lease them the remaining 300metrelong cutting from glengonnar halt so they can extend the line much closer to wanlockhead this is what its all for for me its connecting communities winpenny said more news topics scotland rail transport transport transport policy share
