champions an essay i bought online was so bad i want a refund  but the firm wont pay up the piece was riddled with errors and the revised version was no better now im 200 down it may be legal to buy essays online but it does not say much for students morals photograph alamy rebecca smithers saturday 9 july 2016 0659bst last modified on saturday 9 july 2016 0700bst share on facebook share on twitter share via email share on linkedin share on google share on whatsapp share on messenger i decided to buy a legal essay from an online essaywriting service called law essays help i paid around 200 for something i was promised would be the standard of a 21 degree but i was sent an appalling essay which i do not believe could have been written by an english speaker  and someone who appeared not to have a law degree at least not from the uk i demanded a refund but was instead offered a revised version this did not arrive and when i contacted the firm again it said i would have to wait until the following week  and it was still not prepared to offer me a refund even then the supposedly revised piece of work was the same as the first paper please help me to protect other students from being caught mm london we were shocked by your complaint because you were clearly prepared to cheat to get through your legal studies  which does not reflect well on your moral compass while we were not in a hurry to get your money back sorry we discovered that this website is certainly not a lone player indeed this is a burgeoning but controversial industry with online forums littered with complaints about poorly written essays full of spelling mistakes which dont match the promised grade it is deeply regrettable that students are throwing money at websites like this we phoned the website apparently not the only one reached by the phone number and a spokesman said he had no record of any account in your name he also insisted the essaywriting done for students like you was within the law universities are having to invest in internet plagiarism filters to detect fake work such as this students avoid these websites  you will not only lose money but could also jeopardise your academic career you have been warned meanwhile paul philip chief executive of the solicitors regulation authority says the use of these types of websites not only raises serious questions about whether an individual is meeting the standards required but also whether somebody has the right character to enter a profession where honesty and integrity is crucial  we are looking at wider reforms to introduce a national licensing examination for all intending solicitors to make sure they are reaching the same consistently high standards that the public and employers expect we welcome letters
