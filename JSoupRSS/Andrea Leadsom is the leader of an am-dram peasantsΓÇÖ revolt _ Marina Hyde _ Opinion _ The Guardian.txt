the leader of an amdram peasants revolt marina hyde in this golden age of postfact politics who are we to doubt leadsoms chances of becoming the next prime minister andrea leadsoms smile is terrifying it is the smile of the school careers adviser telling you flatly that the school is looking for a night caretaker photograph rob stothardgetty images contact author marinahyde saturday 9 july 2016

bible student andrea leadsom will know whether she is predicted in the book of revelation for those of us operating on a lower plane condemned to pick through the entrails of the past fortnight the portents are not hugely encouraging on the basis that most things that couldhave gone wrong have there is absolutely no reason to think that andrea doesnt have an excellent chanceof nicking this before we go on however congratulations are in order for the sensationally misguided generation of politicians from gordon brown to david cameron who were always going on about wanting an x factor politics they have finally got their wish im not sure if the official psephological study confirming this is out yet but the referendum result was the exact equivalent of series seven of simon cowells apocalypsebeckoning karaoke show in which essex decorator matt cardle beat one direction one direction dont get me wrong im sure matt is perfectly sufferable im sure you can get through him one way or another but last year one direction were the world of celebritys fourth largest economy and so to the act many can only hope is the wagner in all this on thursday morning andrea leadsom delivered her promised major speech on the economy like shed just won a competition to deliver a major speech on the economy all the eyecatching endorsements had been pouring in for leadsom nigel farage nick griffin katie hopkins there had been rumours that fellow backer boris johnson would introduce her but the former leadership favourite presumably regarded the chance to play the spinal tap to andreas puppet show as simply too much perspective i am an optimist andrea began indeed her cv lists her as a former director of optimism compliance at the bank of unicorns for all please dont regard the developing row over andreas cv as in some way detrimental to her prospects incidentally we are very much not in kansas any more it is already being suggested that the confusion over andreas career in finance will keep the media returning handily to her city background and life beyond politics as one of her key supporters put it delightedly to the times this will turn out to be her 350m claim  the embellishment if that is what it turns out to be that works i dont know about you but im psyched that were already in the secondgolden age of postfact politics  the time when an embellishment is regarded asso brilliant that it harks back to the great embellishments of the first golden age which was last month i want to speak to the markets leadsom smiled with the air of someone who imagines you can negotiate with gravity there was absolutely nothing to fear she went on smiling that smile again andrea leadsoms smile is terrifying it is the smile of the school careers adviser telling you flatly that the school is looking for a night caretaker it is a smile that is powered by the extinguishing of your future you cant escape andreas smile and itll certainly come for you if you try the address ended with her supporters being instructed by leadsom backer penny mordaunt to march up to parliament to impress upon tory mps voting that day the need to do their duty andrea took a car herself but its the thought that counts to watch them make their way up millbank was to picture the walking dead on the countryside alliance march there was drill sergeant tim loughton mp what do we want he demanded leadsom for leader they shouted back when do we want it he inquired now sorry your browser is unable to play this video facebook twitter pinterest what do we want leadsom for leader supporters march on parliament there were tshirts over suits there was perennial stupidest backbencher contender peter bone several nonparty members a brachiosaurus with fairly eyewatering views on civil partnerships and a few prematurely tweeded needtobelongers who  had they been born under other stars  would probably have ended up trying to set fire to their trainers in an aisle seat on a plane the entire event was an amdram peasants revolt metaphor against whichever section of the establishment former banker andrea is pretending not to be part of perhaps it will play brilliantly with the membership as for the rest of us its hard to imagine where we were before andrea was deemed a breakout star of the referendum campaign yet we still know so tantalisingly little about her after all as a junior minister in her majestys government andrea enjoyed the sort of anonymity youd hope for in one of the better witness protection programmes even the verdicts of her friends tend toward the confusing she has steel blethered iain duncan smith but there is a velvet glove of compassion oh iain god knows ive learned to manage my expectations as far as ids is concerned but i would like a secretary of state who understood a basic despot metaphor before he accidentally deployed it i want to speak to the markets leadsom smiled with the air of someone who imagines you can negotiate with gravity other points of intrigue andreas the passionate advocate of attachment theory who wants to abolish maternity rights if youre one of those people whoimagines that the latter two positions are in some way contradictory you are strongly urged to let go of your rational brain and experience andrea as an idea a feeling a repository for thousands of subclinical thatcher fixations which are less an indicator of her calibre than they are of the stigmatisation of asking for help among a particular stripe of tory rank and file at least 50 of her public statements sound as if they were said for a dare lets banish pessimists boris johnson is a lovely man the rest sound like shes assembling endtimes magnetic fridge poetry as a mum leadsom would like her hands on the nuclear codes she likes to retreat to cooking the sunday roast which  contrary to what you may have heard  is not always a homosexual this homespun hardarse stuff is pushed with sledgehammer deliberateness  an attempt to position her as brexits bisto mum which leaves us with theresa may has it really come to this yes yes im afraid it has there are few neater indicators of quitehow far weve travelled over the past 14 days than to find so many people particularly nontory voters now actively yearning for it to be theresa may christ muttered one friend with wry despair i now want this more than i did obama yup were all realpolitikosnow stick a fork in my dreams theyre done more comment topics conservative leadership andrea leadsom conservatives share on facebook share on twitter share via email share on linkedin
