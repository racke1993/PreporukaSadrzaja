roger federer had departed under a cloud he has now reached 11 finals in the four grand slam tournaments one more than fred perry the history man is on the move again meanwhile the swisss defeat over five sets by milos raonic earlier in the afternoon no doubt dismayed everyone from sir alex ferguson in the royal box to that fabled author of fiction jeffrey archer consigned to the paid seats  but murrays win over the world no7 tomas berdych was a thing of joy an uplifting conclusion to a ragged days entertainment murray was well worth his 63 63 63 win in just under two hours and could hardly be in better shape to face raonic a major final debutant at 25 he has a 63 career edge over him the latest in the queens final three weekends ago related milos raonic beats roger federer in five sets to reach wimbledon final the scot will also experience something new  a grand slam decider without the company of either federer or novak djokovic they have been his only opponents at the end of a major  twice at wimbledon where he lost to the swiss in 2012 and beat the serb the following year murray has stuttered eight times in the ultimate test but at 29 and with ivan lendl by his side again he is playing the best tennis of his career he will start favourite against raonic and not just on sentiment according to berdych the fact that probably his biggest rival novak is not in the draw any more definitely helps him the czech said he has the tools to go all the way andy is one of the best in eliminating the big serving weapon of an opponent i think he actually likes to play the big guys to come up with his creative game try to break their rhythm raonic was a not altogether convincing winner federer fell  metaphorically and literally  for the first time in his career according to his own recollection while murray stood tall against a near contemporary who he said beforehand used to bully me a bit on court when they were young  and whom his wife kim had famously badmouthed during their semifinal at the australian open last year was murray shocked by federers defeat yes and no rogers won here i think seven times and been in the final i think a couple more times so anytime he loses its somewhat of a surprise but milos has been playing really good tennis this year  and also on the grass in a match of even quality but not many dramatic moments murray and berdych exchanged early breaks before they hit any sort of rhythm murray once he had settled took the first set with his second ace after 35 minutes there were few early highs fewer lows a careless forehand and a couple of other poor choices cost him two break points in the long sixth game but he served his way out of trouble there was a sense that murray could get the job done in good time if he put more consistent pressure on the fragile berdych serve and he duly broke again to lead 43 berdych all but handed him the second set with a loose and lazy service game murray sinking the dagger a forehand that left the czech clueless at the net after an hour and 22 minutes from there to the line was pretty straightforward as murray held his nerve and berdych scrambled about vainly for an opening under pressure murray just closed him down centre court needed something to rebuild shattered spirits after the first semifinal in which federer fell before the crude power of the young canadian his countrys first finalist in a mens grand slam event it was not a great match  certainly not in the same neighbourhood as the swisss exhilarating comeback from two sets down to beat marin cilic in the quarterfinals on wednesday  and after he crashed to the turf in the third game of the fifth set banging the left knee that required surgery in february we were witness to the painfilled collapse of a legend he had his chances  most notably three break points in the ninth game of the fourth set as well as going 400 up on his serve at 56 before serving two double faults to hand raonic parity in the match  and he was heroic in batting back most of raonics machinegun serves but time did for him in the end this was his best and perhaps final chance to reach for an 18th major title as he described his performance later it wasnt bad it wasnt outstanding it was something i can live with he was sad and angry at himself he said i dont slip a lot i dont ever fall down he fell here can he rise up again not even he knows this one clearly hurts because i felt i could have had it so close but even if federer had made the final  as the entire place was willing him to  it is uncertain if his body would have survived a third searching examination in a row indeed he expressed concern about how his battered knee and the right thigh that he tweaked late in the fourth set might react overnight federer is 35 next month as for raonic he found his best tennis at the end  but there was some patchy stuff before it he did not properly start building points until the last set if he cannot find more consistency in the final he will do well to extend murray today i sort of persevered was the winners prosaic summary i was plugging away i was struggling through many parts of the match he will have no such luxury on sunday more match reports topics andy murray tomas berdych wimbledon 2016 wimbledon tennis share on facebook share on twitter share via email share on linkedin share on google
