breakaway movements with establishment parties enjoying gains and populists dropping points in the polls in germany the brexit aftermath has seen angela merkels popularity ratings surge to a 10month high almost returning to the level the chancellor enjoyed before the height of the refugee crisis last september an infratest dimap poll published on friday also marks a two percentage point gain for merkels party the centreright cdu and a one point gain for the centreleft social democratic party related frauke petry the acceptable face of germanys new right rightwing populist party alternative fr deutschland meanwhile has seen its ratings drop by three percentage points to 11 the antirefugee partys struggles may lie in its leaders failure to contain an internal rift over an antisemitism scandal the brexit debate has fostered a more proeuropean climate among the german population said infratest dimaps managing director michael kunert the government is profiting from this trend while populist eurosceptic parties are suffering in the netherlands seen as one of the countries that could potentially follow britains example support for the freedom party of farright politician geert wilders has fallen to its lowest level since last autumn one poll suggests wilders could win 30 out of the 150 seats in parliament if an election were held now three fewer than a week ago though his party remains the most popular in the fragmented dutch political landscape wilders this week pressed ahead with his vow to make a nexit referendum one of the key themes of the general election next march calling the eu a totalitarian sovietlike institution though brexit may partly explain wilders declining fortunes the poll also reflects dutch voters lukewarm attitude to brussels the main winners were the socialist party which advocates a eurosceptic approach but stops short of wanting to pull out of the eu the centreright christian democrats and the proeuropean liberal d66 group also did well related why the dutch wont rush to nexit and follow britain out of the eu  joris luyendijk the resulting political chaos and economic uncertainty of brexit appears to have had a direct effect on attitudes in austria where a eurosceptic populist candidate will stand in the repeat presidential elections on 2 october in a gallup poll on 56 july 52 of austrians said they would choose to stay in the eu if given a vote while only 30 would vote to leave a similar poll the previous week had shown a more balanced picture with 51 in favour of remain and 49 in favour of leave the change in mood appears to have also affected the views of the antiimmigration freedom partys presidential candidate having previously advocated a referendum if the eu were to take steps towards further integration norbert hofer told die presse on friday that he was not in favour of an austrian exit from the european union i have been annoyed for days that this is being insinuated i was not amused it would undoubtedly damage austria if it were to leave the eu hofer said in denmark support for eu membership has risen to 69 up from 598 in a poll held before the british referendum while support for a membership vote has fallen from 407 to 32 in finland voters seem to have been put off the idea of a fixit vote which had been called for by some politicians including former foreign minister paavo vyrynen after polls carried out in march indicated that 43 of voting finns wanted a ukstyle referendum and only 56 were inclined to vote to remain an iltalehti survey carried out on 2829 june registered a proeuropean shift with 59 of finns saying they did not want an inout referendum and 68 saying they would vote to stay the picture is more balanced in southern europe in france the farright antieu and antiimmigration front national has remained stable in the polls its leader marine le pen is widely expected to get through to the final round of the presidential race in spring 2017 but is not predicted to win the runoff in italy the political landscape has shifted over the last two weeks but there have been both losses and gains for eurosceptic parties support for the farright and antiimmigration northern league whose leader matteo salvini has called for a ukstyle referendum has slipped by 07 to 124 according to a poll published earlier this week italians are increasingly likely to favour the antiestablishment five star movement now the countrys most popular party with 306 of the vote while the ruling democratic party has fallen to 298 the five star movement has not called for a public vote on eu membership but instead backs a nonbinding referendum on the euro while there is widespread scepticism of brussels a majority of italians believe they are better off in the eu one poll carried out since the brexit outcome found 66 of italians would vote to remain in the eu with just 26 opting to leave and 8 undecided more news topics european union
