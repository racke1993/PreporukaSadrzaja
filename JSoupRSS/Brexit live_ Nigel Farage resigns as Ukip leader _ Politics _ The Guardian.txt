accuses osborne of wanting to turn uk into a giant tax haven john mcdonnell the shadow chancellor has condemned george osbornes proposal to cut corporation tax to below 15 in a statement he said this is a futile and costly gesture from a lameduck chancellor who is clean out of ideas after being forced to abandon his failing flagship austerity programme george osborne is already set to slash corporation taxes to among the lowest rate in the g20 but despite falling corporate tax rates uk investment has shrunk in both of the last two quarters even with record profits and uk companies sitting on a 700bn cash pile instead of turning the whole country into a giant tax haven and playground for the ultrarich the chancellor needs to get a grip on the real problems by reversing planned cuts to government investment and bringing forward shovelready projects for those areas worst affected by the investment slump and the shock of brexit facebook twitter google plus share share this post facebook twitter google plus close 930am bst 0930 the bbcs norman smith is reporting that jeremy corbyns critics are now prepared to wait until after the chilcot report is published on wednesday before triggering a leadership challenge see 918am but in his column in the herald alex salmond the former scottish first minister suggests the coup against corbyn began last week precisely because his opponents wanted him out before chilcot heres an extract i have been puzzling as to exactly why the parliamentary labour party chose this moment to launch their coup against jeremy corbyn and just what explains the desperation to get him out last week it can hardly be because of a european referendum where corbyns campaigning although less than energetic was arguably more visible than that of say the likely big political winner teresa may would it not have been more sensible and certainly less damaging simply to put up another candidate against corbyn and argue the case to the country it certainly would have made for less of a pantomime and with both establishment parties holding simultaneous leadership elections it would have minimised the damage so what exactly was the urgency in getting the removal vans to visit the corbyns office last week i had a conversation on exactly this point with veteran labour firebrand dennis skinner he answered in one word iraq the skinner line is that the coup was timed to avoid corbyn calling for blairs head next wednesday from the dispatch box indeed many would say that when corbyn stated that he would be prepared to see a former labour prime minister tried for war crimes then he sealed his fate as leader of the parliamentary labour party updated at 935am bst facebook twitter google plus share share this post facebook twitter google

that she will mount a leadership challenge against jeremy corbyn if he does not respond to his critics by resigning she implies although she does not actually say that this is what she told reporters outside her home this morning corbyn is not properly engaged with even the deputy leader of the party who is elected with a mandate too it is now time that he did so there are many people  mps party members up and down the country  asking me to resolve this impasse and i will if something is not done soon  i have the support to run and resolve this impasse and i will do so if jeremy does not take action soon but the bbcs norman smith reports that corbyns critics say they are prepared to wait until after wednesday when corbyn will be responding to the publication of the chilcot report into the

using borrowing to create 100bn growing britain fund it was a shame that john mcdonnell was not asked about a plan being proposed by stephen crabb the work and pensions secretary who is one of the five candidates for the conservative leadership it would have been nice to hear mcdonnells reaction because crabbs plan sounds like undiluted corbynism as the bbc reports crabb is proposing to create a 100bn growing britain fund that would use government borrowing to fund infrastructure investment crabb would put money into projects including flood defences a national fibreoptic broadband network crossrail 2 social housing school buildings and new prisons and he and his ally sajid javid the business secretary believe this would create hundreds of thousands of new jobs stephen crabb on itvs

sparrow good morning im andrew sparrow taking over from claire john mcdonnell the shadow chancellor is on the today programme he says jeremy cobyn is a winner he has won every byelection labour has fought since the election and held councils in the local election that labour was expected to lose he says he is asking people in labour to stand back and have a proper rational conversation about the future q you talk softly but your message is unbending you dont mind if you cannot fill shadow cabinet posts you are not prepared to compromise mcdonnell says that is not true he wants to hear what peoples concerns are q their concern is that corbyn is a loser  mcdonnell says they are wrong his record shows that he wants to hear what other worries are q labour figures say they cannot get to see corbyn that is not true says mcdonnell corbyn has an opendoor policy he will meet any mps q so angela eagle can have a onetoone meeting with corbyn and tom watson there have been reports saying corbyn is refusing to meet his shadow cabinet critics or refusing to meet them without key advisers present mcdonnell says of course corbyn will be willing to hold meetings with people like eagle mcdonnell

0831 while in the uk legal moves and opinion columns ponder the possibility of not triggering article 50 eu officials are wondering the same thing politico reports what if the uk never withdraws the eu cannot force the uk to notify its withdrawal but it could try to invoke sanctions under article 7 using the rationale that the political and economic uncertainty created by the delay is undermining the union but thats unlikely tusks top aide piotr serafin urged national diplomats at their meeting last week to remember that the uk is going through a crisis and they should avoid escalating it by threatening sanctions in the meantime jeanclaude junckers chief of staff martin selmayr suggested at the meeting with diplomats last sunday according to a source present that the eu treat the results of the british referendum the same way it has treated the results of the dutch referendum in april on trade with ukraine by leaving it in limbo so here too the plan might well be  to not have a plan
