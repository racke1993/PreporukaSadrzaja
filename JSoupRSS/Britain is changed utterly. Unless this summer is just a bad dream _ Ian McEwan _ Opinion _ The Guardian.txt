unless this summer is just a bad dream ian mcewan as the political crisis of our generation continues to unfold and the tories prepare to choose a new prime minister most of us can only gossip

share on linkedin share on google share on whatsapp share on messenger its easy enough these days to wake troubled even before you remember the cause then you do everything is changed utterly or about to be as soon as your new leader is chosen the country you live in the parliamentary democracy that ruled it for good or bad has been trumped by a plebiscite of dubious purpose and unacknowledged status from our agriculture to our science and our universities from our law to our international relations to our commerce and trade and politics and who and what we are in the world  all is up for a curious unequal renegotiation with our european neighbours how did we get to this what can you do related dont confuse the conservatives embrace of female leaders with feminism  eve livingston by now you are putting on your shoes and running through the sequence yet one more time the conservative party needed to settle an old dispute within its ranks the quarrel once wrecked the sleep of john major the schism needed to be healed to shore up the position and sleep of david cameron certain newspaper owners and a large minority of tory backbenchers had to be appeased the promise to let the people decide was in the conservative manifesto and the country had voted for a conservative government it was legal and proper to have a referendum the campaign was conducted by and was an argument between conservative politicians  at its simplest cameronosborne against johnsongove the role of ukip was merely to make everyone else seem reasonable we watched and wondered as kremlinologists once did the jeremy corbyn labour party was shamefully or shamelessly absent until it was too late the status of the 2015 parliamentary act that enabled the referendum was clear but we didnt read it was it advisory like some referendums are or was it binding the question didnt come up we failed to ask it no use declaring as you may keep declaring after it didnt go your way that all along it was merely advisory you should have thought of that earlier and what was the nations democratically tendered advice to our lawmakers that were almost evenly split one third wants to leave fractionally less than a third wants to stay and a third doesnt know or doesnt care seventeen million against 16 million each full of contempt for the other and on this basis and unlike any other country in the world we are about to redraft our constitution and much else besides youll be at the coffee before you remember all over again the lies that needed to be told to gain the result the 350m a week that would become available to the nhs that we could halt immigration from europe and remain in the single market that turkey was about to join that we could take back our country  as if any international treaty was not in a rulebound context a diminution of sovereignty in exchangefor a greater good the minority of us who read newspapers know less than a tenth of whats happening on your second cup you might check online for the conservative party rules for selecting a new leader as if knowing them might empower you somehow or you might take another look at the far simpler article 50 that sets out the means of our departure barely 400 words remarkably easy to read given that it was drawn up by lawyers when weve invoked the clause were committed to leave within two years our partners dont want to negotiate with us until the article is invoked if these were the rules of a card game only a mug would sit down to play the banker takes all how can parliament even assuming it has a say vote on a deal it cannot see until its too late and yet we are told even by the defeated tory remainer faction that the people have spoken perhaps this is what the party wanted all along  all of it we hardly know the minority of us who read newspapers know less than a tenth of whats happening but we can be sure of the contempt each tory caucus holds for the others with some contempt to spare for us bystanders sorry your browser is unable to play this video facebook twitter pinterest andrea leadsom nobody needs to fear uks decision to leave eu we may assume that powerful conservative figures wanted boris johnson gone for historical as well as proximal reasons someone lofty may have spoken smoothly into the ear of his lieutenant michael gove to persuade him he was prime minister material and that he should desert when he did and johnson stepped aside a socalled grandee michael heseltine was on hand to disembowel the corpse then for his 15 minutes gove was before us crossgartered like foolish malvolio until another grandee kenneth clarke in concert with the daily mail was ready to knife his guts two down in thesummer of contempt or it happened another way we kremlinologists can only guess at whatsbeing turned over in the clubs of st james or the farmhouses of oxfordshire but we do know that what all sides are calling the greatest political crisis of our generation is a creature imagined into being by the conservative party alone it not ukip offered the referendum it fought it it won as well as lost it for such services for the mayhem and poison that followed and are clouding the leadership contest we should now be watching it shredded by an effective eloquent opposition but by their silence corbyn and his troubled paranoid court have delivered us in effect and for the time being into a oneparty state and not the leninist version certain courtiers dream of now you watch on helplessly as your prime minister is chosen it is of course constitutionally correct that you have no say in the matter but its hard to shake off that belowstairs feeling we can do no more than gossip round the kitchen table the butler has a theory and so does the second chambermaid even boots knows all about tactical voting our firstnaming paradoxically measures our distance from events is boris biding his time or is he truly finished what does it tell us about the party post 2008 that andrea an exbanker hostile to the minimum wage could soon be prime minister was theresas reticence during the referendum campaign astute and tactical or merely an expression of her character or is she the remainers mole can we believe that the chancellor isnt plotting we hear footsteps above our head  more comings and goings but who related the word from fleet i dont see theresa may as another backstabber you might cling to the butlers mole theory even as you worry that your hopes are loosening your grip on reality the powerful faction that wanted to remain and whispered flattery and enticements in goves ear has cleared the field of johnson the other sides most powerful contender and eased one of itsown into place as pm the exit negotiations begin and are inevitably protracted in a game with such stacked odds our european friends watching their own backs will not be offering kindly terms only a fool would want to invoke the dread article too soon meanwhile the economy is in decline the pound is drifting towards parity with the dollar the jobless lines are lengthening racists and xenophobes are gripped by an elated sense of entitlement the cry gets louder for a second referendum the voices come from the only quarter that matters  the party exattorney general dominic grieve is among the first then some exministers then those grandees again at last with no loss of face prime minister may reluctantly grants their wish its what in her heart she always wanted and clearly the public mood has shifted on hardpressed council estates leavers are suffering what weve learned to call buyers remorse second time around remain sweeps the board were back in in fact we never left it was all a bad dream the summer of contempt will be soon forgotten take your shoes off go back to bed when you wake boris johnson will be leader of the labour party he was he says always well to the left of tony blair what can you do more comment topics eu referendum european union foreign
