the snug by the fire glasses of sherry cobbler and rum flip in hand this cosy quarter is furnished with period furniture long curtains and hunting prints if my sister and i venture to the bar for another drink we stand a good chance of bumping into lady scarsdale who often calls in for a vt after walking the dogs we could have timetravelled to an 18thcentury country house in a way we have the great and the good of derby have been flocking to kedleston since robert adam  famed for kenwood house and osterley park in london  built it in the 1760s the first aristocratic visitors came here to take the sulphurous waters it was hoped that the area about four miles northwest of the city would develop into a spa town to rival buxton and matlock but sadly the springs dried up after a period as a family farmhouse the building reverted to a hotel in 1967 it became a hangout for derby county footballers and their legendary manager brian clough the team drowned their sorrows in the bar when he resigned in october 1973 the hotels fortunes then began to wane and while it lingered as a teenage party venue for a while it had lain abandoned and boarded up for the past few years  a scandal for a grade iilisted building the star rating is down to that fantastic original fireplace in the snug facebook twitter pinterest enter the derby brewing company this small family company had already restored three historic but rundown derby pubs  the tap the greyhound and the queens head  before turning its attention to this similarly historic rundown hotel five years and 750000 invested the place reopened last summer as the kedleston country house it is still owned by the curzon family aka the scarsdales and is part of the adambuilt kedleston hall estate the hall itself is now owned by the national trust as well as the snug theres a parlour with high ceilings a woodpanelled study a refined dining room and an orangery the restored hotel is a delight the beautifully balanced georgian proportions have been reinstated large windows squaredoff doorways grand entrance hall sweeping staircase with archive photographs on the wall downstairs there are inviting nooks and crannies as well as the snug my favourite room and the bar there is a bright parlour with high ceilings and original sash windows a hidden woodpanelled study a refined dining room and an orangery overlooking the garden the latter has been relocated from the front of the house and planted according to adams designs including a kitchen garden orchard and croquet lawn  though like any new garden it is a work in progress the whole ground floor would be wonderful to hire for a party upstairs there are three rooms and two suites ours is the kedleston suite a calm oasis in shades of taupe with a superkingsize pencil post bed window seats and velvet chaise longue there are lamps sourced from local antiques fairs botanical pictures and an enormous freestanding mirror the bathroom halftiled in grey has a clawfoot bath and monsoon shower and is stocked with plum  ashby products the latter also make the cute dog prints that adorn the cushions curtains and hotwater bottles the mini bar is more of a larder stocked with oldfashioned sweets and craft beer and every room has a free bottle of kedleston gin facebook twitter pinterest it is a real treat to stay here but with just five rather pricy rooms the restaurant is the main business judging by the packed dining room it is doing well but it would take a worldclass chef to do justice to the surroundings over two nights only one dish stands out a delicate starter of roast and pickled heritage beetroot with goats cheese 595 the crab and crayfish cocktail and the pork belly are average the huge lump of calves liver 1195 downright unappetising a hotel of this calibre should have a short daily changing menu it certainly shouldnt have a bizarresounding sharing main board of rump steak sea bass fish fingers potatoes greens quinoa salad and tartar sauce 3495 breakfast is better the continental option included in the room rate is served on sweet individual tiered cake stands with fruit cured meats cheese cakes and pastries the full derbyshire will set you back an extra 12 the disappointing dinner notwithstanding it is wonderful that a piece of derbys rich history has been brought back to life back in the snug we celebrate with another brace of georgianinspired cocktails 795  the british take on a negroni with strawberry gin and bitter rosehip liqueur seems a particularly fitting tribute to the light elegant adam style
