to blair both were totally reckless jonathan freedland trusting too much in their powers of persuasion both men misunderstood britains place in the world  and unleashed havoc illustration by robert g

whatsapp share on messenger so painful was the loss of the city across the channel mary tudor predicted that anyone gazing upon her heart after her death would find engraved there a single word calais when the day comes we surely know what word will be etched into the heart of tony blair it will be iraq and for david cameron europe for both of these prime ministers  and remember one liked to see himself as the heir to the other  a single decision brought catastrophe the word is not metaphorical in blairs case as this weeks chilcot report laid bare at least 150000 iraqis  and probably many more  lost their lives following the 2003 invasion and more than a million lost their homes displaced and dispossessed for cameron the havoc unleashed by the brexit result is so far of the nonlethal variety still the reports of hate crimes keep coming 3000 such incidents in england and wales in the last two weeks of june an increase of 43 on 2015 according to the police related david cameron resigns after uk votes to leave european union history will define both cameron andblair by these choices although cameron will have less than blair to put on the positive side of the ledger he could mention equal marriage as he did in his 24 june resignation speech along with a gracious apology for bloody sunday but set against a decision that has already seen the pound become the worlds worst performing currency in 2016 and whose economic damage will be felt for years if not decades a decision that is likely to trigger a scottish vote for independence and the breakup of the united kingdom they might not count for much blair will have much more to enter in the credit column peace in northern ireland devolution for scotland and wales the human rights act a minimum wage a decade of decent funding for the nhs  it could have been quite a legacy but it was all outweighed even erased in the public mind by the disaster of war in iraq the result is that these two men the dominant political figures of the past two decades are fated to be judged harshly by posterity oddly their immediate predecessors  both derided as dull charismafree zones in comparison  will fare better john major quietly laid the ground for northern irish peace and presided over several years of growth gordon brown kept britain out of the euro and prevented the postcrash recession from turning into a second great depression above all neither major nor brown started a needless war or wrecked britains national prospects  thereby clearing the low bar now set by their respective successors related tony blair unrepentant as chilcot gives crushing iraq war verdict the manner of these two fateful decisions was different of course camerons mistake was to listen too much to his backbench rebels it was pressure from his noisy eurosceptic wing that pushed him into making his 2013 promise of an inout referendum he was spooked by the idea that ukip could cost the tories seats in 2015 but ukip had no mps at the time zero he didnt need to buckle the way he did blairs mistake was in the other direction he did not listen to the labour rebels  139 of them  who voted against military action in march 2003 and who had been agitating against war for months if he had he could have averted calamity but its the common elements of the two decisions that are more intriguing chilcot saved some of his most stringent criticism for blairs plans for the aftermath of the invasion they were he said wholly inadequate cameron is under fire now for his failure to ensure that whitehall did sufficient contingency planning for brexit in the latter case what was missing was not simply a treasury todo list in the event of a leave vote camerons greater failure was that he did not think through the implications of his actions he failed to realise what he was risking by holding this vote in this way at this time the scotland factor alone should have stayed his hand and much as chilcot said of blair these dangers did not require hindsightthey were foreseeable and foreseen at the time sorry your browser is unable to play this video facebook twitter pinterest tony blair i accept full responsibility for iraq war decision both blair and cameron believed too much in their own persuasive gifts as the i will be with you whatever memo conveys blair thought he could win over george w bush to his way of thinking whether that be taking the un route or making a serious effort at israelipalestinian peace cameron similarly overestimated his powers of persuasion believing when he promised a referendum that he would seduce his fellow european leaders into giving him what he wanted in his much vaunted renegotiation of britains eu membership like blair before him he was destined to be disappointed related camerons bad bet the drama of a night that ripped britain apart within that shared mistake was a smaller but significant one both blair and cameron were convinced that what mattered most was the man or woman at the top blair invested all his energy in bush failing to understand that power in the us system extends beyond the oval office he paid insufficient heed to the alternative power centres to the likes of dick cheney and donald rumsfeld who outmanoeuvred and outgunned him cameron similarly reckoned that the only person who mattered was angela merkel he thought that if only he could work his charm on her she would give him what he needed to sell a renegotiated eu membership to a sullen british electorate he was forgetting that in the eu there is not one decider there are 27 member states to be won over to get the kind of deal he wanted cameron should have acted like his european counterparts nurturing relationships over many years instead he left himself weeks in both cases such ignorance proved calamitous ive long believed that the key to understanding blairs motive in iraq was his conception of new labour in short whatever old labour had done new labour would do the opposite so as steve richards argued in the guardian this week because old labour had been estranged from the us and republican presidents in particular new labour would stand with them shoulder to shoulder but that broad strategy betrayed a woeful naivety about american politics blair simply did not understand the nature of the republican devil with whom he had chosen to sup those of us who had seen the republican party up close in washington in that period knew that it bristled with dangerous ideologues best approached from a distance but blair was determined to be as close to bush as he had to bill clinton he refused to see the difference related millions of us knew the iraq war would be a catastrophe why didnt tony blair  max richter that spoke to a larger myopia blair and cameron shared both men had a lopsided vision of britains place in the world one that placed too much weight on our relationship with the us and too little on our relationship with continental europe blair was ready to ignore the objections of paris and berlin who opposed the invasion just so he could stand with washington as blair repeated this week his prime objective was always to be americas number one ally meanwhile cameron was prepared to jeopardise britains place in europe just to get himself out of a hole dug by nigel farage and bill cash the act of calling such a referendum before hed gained the concessions that might have won it revealed that he regarded the european relationship as essentially dispensable david cameron once revelled in the title heir to blair he might rethink that now as he reflects on how much they had in common  two men who will each be remembered for a single decision of utter recklessness one that history will be slow to forgive more comment topics
