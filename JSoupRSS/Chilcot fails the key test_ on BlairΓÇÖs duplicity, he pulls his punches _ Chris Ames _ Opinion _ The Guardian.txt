who loved to fix things asked a group of establishment figures to carry out a lessons learned inquiry that was not supposed to reach a finding on the legality of the 2003 invasion its a truism to which ive often resorted that the tendency of any establishment inquiry is to assume that while mistakes were made everyone acted in good faith and no one lied thus after the chilcot report was published this week we had blair crowing there had been no lies parliament and the cabinet had not been misled there had been no secret commitment to war intelligence had not been falsified and the decision had been made in good faith this was blairs spin on what the report said in fact it avoided making any judgments that suggested blair misled anyone for me the key test was whether the inquiry would nail the lie that blair was seeking to achieve a resolution of the issue of iraqs alleged weapons of mass destruction by peaceful means for a while the knowledge that the inquiry would publish the previously leaked downing street documents suggested that it would acknowledge the truth that blair had from the outset signed up for regime change but it didnt the chilcot report quotes blair as acknowledging that there were two distinct options within the iraq options paper in march 2002 containment or regime change it then quotes blairs evidence that the option he picked was to confront and change rather than continue to manage the issue but it then asserts that blairs government fused the two options together by issuing an ultimatum to iraq  and reconciled its objective of disarming iraq if possible by peaceful means with the us goal of regime change other documents show that regime change was blairs approach from the outset for example his foreign affairs adviser david manning told the us national security adviser condoleezza rice the same month that blair would not budge in his support for regime change in the report chilcot seems to accept mannings implausible claim that this unequivocal commitment was actually about setting conditions worse the fact that the then british ambassador to the us christopher meyer told another bush official about the need to wrongfoot saddam on the un inspectors does not get a mention it has now been confirmed that in july 2002 blair told bush whose public policy was regime change i will be with you whatever the whatever meant participating in regime change even without going to the un fastforward to february 2003 when saddam had allowed the inspectors in via un resolution 1441 in another note to bush blair suggested a new resolution setting out what full cooperation from saddam looked like he listed among the disadvantages of this he might conceivably comply fully chilcots narrative makes plain this duplicity but does not describe it as such instead bending over backwards to excuse the way the governments public statements on iraqs alleged wmd were understandably written in more direct and less nuanced language than the jic join intelligence committee assessments on which they drew understandably chilcot is not shy about editorialising he does go on to criticise blairs claim in the notorious dossier that intelligence had established beyond doubt that saddam had wmd and comes close to calling him a liar but he gives blair two getoutofjailfree cards he notes that blair expressed this unjustified certainty as his belief and states that he will not question this while noting that the deliberate selection of the i believe formulation indicates a distinction between his beliefs and the jics actual judgements the logical implication of this formulation is an awareness of the distinction  an intent to mislead as clare short would say chilcot wont say so choosing in addition to blame intelligence officers for not preventing the exaggeration on both regime change and wmd chilcots determination to pull his punches is unsurprising given his role on the panel of an earlier whitewash the 2004 butler inquiry that inquiry fudged the issue of blairs intent and his responsibility for overstating the certainty of intelligence but chilcot also avoids addressing the falsity of blairs claim  a key part of his pitch for parliamentary backing  that president jacques chirac of frances alleged threat to veto any second resolution had scuppered britains chances of getting one although the report sets out the many facts that make it clear this claim was untrue  including the expectation that in the unlikely event that the required nine positive votes were gained russia would use its veto  it studiously avoids making any key findings on this part of the story chilcots perverse refusal to acknowledge blairs duplicity is infuriating not least because this creates a culture in which such behaviour flourishes but ultimately what we needed from chilcot was the facts of what happened over iraq now we have most of those we can make up our own minds more comment topics iraq war
