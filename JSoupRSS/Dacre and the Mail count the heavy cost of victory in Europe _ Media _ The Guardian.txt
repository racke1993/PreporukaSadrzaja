dacre peter preston on press and broadcasting dacre and the mail count the heavy cost of victory in europe peter preston brexit was the choice of dmgts indomitable editorinchief but at what price to his prospects his proprietor or his company paul dacre fruits of victory a trifle wizened photograph peter macdiarmidgetty images saturday 9 july 2016 1026bst last modified on saturday 9 july 2016 1107bst share on facebook share on twitter share via email share on linkedin share on google share on whatsapp share on messenger now let us all praise famous men his power is far less fleeting than mere politicians he has seen prime ministers and governments come and go and sits in judgment upon them he helps bring governments down and dispenses justice with a flourish of his hand upon a set of proofs that supreme being is daily mail editor paul dacre the quote comes from another editor dominic ponsford at the uk press gazette but it could in truth have come from many friends  and quite a few foes  of dacre for as boris and gove and farage tumble from the top of the brexit heap so paul dacre remains in place you may or may not think that the mail won it on 23 june theres plenty of sketchily rehearsed argument on either side but you have to acknowledge that dacre with his railings against greedy elites and harpings on project fear natural successor to frankenstein foods hit the precise notes that brought leave victory oracle or echo chamber it doesnt much matter because hes still there and still triumphant except perhaps that the fruits of victory are beginning to look a trifle wizened here are the seasoned observers of enders analysis on uk media prospects so far 2016 has been a wretched year for uk news publishers with a marked acceleration in the decline of print display advertising revenue we predict a decline of 15 this year and our central case forecast assumes the same scale of decline in 2017 what difference does brexit make it subtracts as much a 10 more revenue points to coming ad decline it drives more nails into the coffin it wipes hundreds of millions off daily mail and general trust shares it turns a wretched year into a hideous one is everybody in and around the kensington atrium happythen you couldnt expect jonathan rothermere to manifest much enthusiasm his heart and his business interests were best served by the mail on sundays remain line dacre won the big boss lost  and so perhaps did paul zwillenberg rothermeres choice as incoming group chairman an american digital wizard and chum who may not become instantly enraptured by a 67yearold autocrat of daily mail print wisdom pursuing policies that do the empire no good in one sense of course the legend of the supreme being still lingers here paul dacre is no meek lackey to the contrary hes obviously independent he paddles his own canoe upstream he once turned down a big job offer from murdoch but the problem with a oneman operation often against the grain is that such shows cant run forever will it be two or more years before brexit actually happens will dacre  whose health isnt great  still be in charge hitting 70 he can choose his new deputy gerard greaves from the mail on sunday but he cant turn him into a new dacre  too cussed for cloning too robust to succumb to the suits of high office he wont as revenues slither further this autumn be in pole position to decide the mails fortune the worldbusting but still unprofitable website isnt his baby his editorinchief authority doesnt cross the atrium did he climb aboard the may bandwagon a tad too quickly leaving a pensive sun to play catchup are second thoughts of vulnerability creeping in dont doubt the shock and awe  the political clout  paul dacre still commands but also remember perhaps that all political careers end in disappointment  william reesmogg once editor of the times was a magisterial figure prone to repeated thunderous pronouncements  most of which rapidly turned out to be wrong he was variously mad mogg or mystic mogg in private eye parlance rival leader writers used to wait to find out what william thought before advocating the precise opposite and now heres his beloved son jacob reesmogg telling telegraph readers that michael gove would be a prime minister as great as churchill and thatcher ah the decades roll away thats moggnificent  why conspiracy theories come adrift the mail voted leave with all its might and andrea leadsom is leaves pm contender but its forensic saturday job on andreas shifting cv claims was as comprehensive a compilation as you could wish murdoch hailed brexit but his times voted remain  and kept the tape running while it talked to leadsom about the supreme glories of mumhood who on earth thought that disputing that despicable but deadaccurate tale was a good idea wholl believe the next dodgy denial you cant always write the script of automatic support dacres paper still turns over stones and reporters from papers across the spectrum have recordings will travel what will happen as the reach of papers and newsrooms withers when national news means broadcasters usowned sites and blogs fewer tapes fewer questions fewer
