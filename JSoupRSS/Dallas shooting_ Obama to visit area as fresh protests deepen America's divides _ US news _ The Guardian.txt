for almost two years obama will head early next week to dallas a city reeling from the deadliest day for american police since the september 11 terrorist attacks the white house said as protests against the fatal shootings of black men by officers continued across the country he will also try to bring people together to support our police officers and communities and find common ground by discussing policy ideas for addressing the persistent racial disparities in our criminal justice system said his press secretary josh earnest related dallas shooting suspect stated he wanted to kill white officers obamas decision was announced as demonstrations against the use of excessive force by police spread again on friday night to cities such as baltimore atlanta and philadelphia thousands of protesters marched and blocked traffic on highways to draw fresh attention to what has become a new civil rights movement cutting short a planned tour of spain the first black us president will return to a nation whose stark divide on race was brought to the fore once again by the assassination of five policemen in dallas by a black military veteran said to have been targeting white people they were the first deaths of law enforcement around demonstrations over the use of force by police since the intense unrest sparked by the fatal police shooting of an unarmed black 18yearold in ferguson missouri in the summer of 2014 conservatives were quick to accuse obama of having blood on his hands for delivering remarks hours before the dallas shootings in which he urged white americans to take seriously the black lives matter protest movements grievances over racism in the criminal justice system facebook twitter pinterest a makeshift memorial at dallas police headquarters one day after a lone gunman ambushed and killed five police officers at a protest decrying police shootings of black men photograph shannon stapletonreuters he was sharply criticised by heather mac donald an influential rightwing author who is a leading proponent of the socalled ferguson effect which holds that crime has spiked since the unrest in missouri because frontline police officers have been pushed into a retreat accusing obama of attacking the very foundation of civilisation by giving credibility to black lives matter mac donald told the conservative radio host rush limbaugh the president had lied to the nation and we see the results apparently referring to the dallas shootings steve king a republican congressman for iowa even claimed the dallas shootings were rooted in a sevenyearold row over race prompted when obama said a white officer acted stupidly by arresting a black harvard academic trying to gain entry to his own home obama had in fact struck a careful balance stressing that despite legitimate concerns american should have an extraordinary appreciation and respect for the vast majority of police officers describing their job as dangerous and difficult he spoke again on friday after the dallas shootings to call the attack vicious calculated and despicable sorry your browser is unable to play this video facebook twitter pinterest barack obama dallas shootings a despicable attack the reaction however reflected a consistently sharp divide on the subject among americans a pew poll last month found 84 of black americans believe police treat blacks unfairly compared with 50 of white respondents while more than twothirds of african americans support the black lives matter movement a minority of white people  and just 20 of republicans  feel the same way the presidents comments were prompted by fresh anger over the fatal shootings by police of two black men in louisiana and minnesota both deaths were partially captured on mobile phone video footage that was widely shared online amplifying public concern authorities in dallas said that micah johnson the deceased gunman had been upset by the shootings in recent days of alton sterling in baton rouge and philando castile near st paul sterling was shot while pinned down by officers during a struggle in which a pistol remained in his pocket castile was shot while reaching for his identification documents after warning the officer he was legally carrying a firearm his girlfriend said johnson a 25yearold army reservist who served in afghanistan was killed by a bombcarrying police robot after lengthy negotiations in which he articulated anger at the police shootings and said he wanted to kill white people especially white officers from a perch at a parking garage he had shot dead officers lorne ahrens michael krol michael smith brent thompson and patrick zamarripa and wounded seven others he used an ar15 rifle similar to that used in past highprofile mass shootings such as the massacre of primary school pupils in sandy hook connecticut in december 2012 those who lived among johnson and his family expressed astonishment at his involvement i would have never believed that someone from this neighbourhood could have had feelings like that said robert olsovsky 55 who lives close to the large detached house where johnson resided with his mother yet this wellmaintained modern family home with a basketball hoop in the back yard next door and children playing in an adjacent street as media and law enforcement thronged the area apparently harboured what police described as an arsenal of bombmaking materials ballistic vests rifles ammunition and a personal journal of combat tactics related our hearts are big in dallas griefstricken city comes together for vigil law enforcement officials said late on friday that johnson appeared to have acted alone three other suspects had been held in custody but authorities in dallas had provided mixed signals about their importance to the investigation and their status remained unclear as it entered the weekend the city remained in a shocked state of mourning candles were laid out on concrete bollards in front of the dallas police headquarters and stars and stripes stickers sat in a box waiting to be taken an inscription scribbled on the box in cursive read 772016 remember our fallen heroes honor our dpd heroes still among us the streets surrounding el centro community college from which johnson apparently mounted his attack remained cordoned off with police stationed along nearby roads on friday
