horrific week of violence in the us has cast into sharp relief the troubled relationship between black communities and law enforcement this latest cycle of violence began with the police shooting death of 37yearold alton sterling in baton rouge louisiana outside a convenience store a video surfaced showing sterling being shot by a police officer several times in the chest during a struggle on the ground the next day police near st paul minnesota shot philando castile a 32yearold cafeteria supervisor with no criminal record after a routine traffic violation castiles girlfriend diamond reynolds livestreamed the shootings aftermath on her facebook page her calm shellshocked narration offered stunning documentary evidence of castiles last gasps of life her own efforts to make sense of the events and her being comforted by her fouryearold daughter who witnessed the shooting the dual impact of both videos which quickly went viral on social media forced public officials to confront the continuing crisis of institutional racism in law enforcement publicly with minnesotas governor mark dayton admitting that castile would not have been killed if he had been white and barack obama calling the shootings an american problem the problem grew exponentially in dallas last night where a peaceful rally in memory of sterling and castile turned into an unprecedented moviestyle assault on police officers that left five dead and eight wounded the shooter 25yearold micah johnson told negotiators he wanted to kill white people especially white officers he was allegedly angry over the recent shootings of sterling and castile related dallas is a tragedy for all of us and shouldnt shut down calls for justice  ijeoma oluo a week that started with black people feeling under siege at the hands of law enforcement has come full circle with police officers feeling equally embattled the cycle of racial violence oppression grief and loss has resulted in the creation of a feedback loop we see activists passionately make their case that black lives are being taken by a system of racially biased policing and then we see law enforcement advocates insist they are heroic civil servants engaged in difficult and dangerous work this work they argue is made even more difficult by protests and demonstrations that endanger their lives and the publics some of the roots of this weeks crisis can be traced back to ferguson missouri a tiny suburb outside of st louis that although twothirds black featured an overwhelmingly white police force and leadership in municipal politics this unequal power relation came to a head almost two years ago after the fatal shooting of 18yearold black teenager michael brown related dallas doesnt represent civil war but a society that needs fundamental change  barret holmes pitner browns uncovered body lay for hours on the street sparking protests around the nation that were galvanized by a hashtag blacklivesmatter that would grow into a national antiracist movement blm founders alicia garza opal tometi and patrisse cullors helped to innovate a movement that has flourished nationally led by local activists and leaders the movement has argued that americas criminal justice system is a gateway to multiple systems of oppression linking mass incarceration and the drug war to what michelle alexander has called the new jim crow of punitive treatment against black people to failing public schools unemployment residential segregation and poverty that grips much of the black community over the past roughly 24 months black lives matter emerged as the face of a new movement for racial economic gender and sexuality justice in american society what critics labeled as identity politics supporters characterized as intersectionality  a word used to described how the personal including race gender class sexuality always impacts and shapes the political the movement for black lives has profoundly shaped contemporary civil rights activism with a broad array of demonstrations and protests organizing themselves under the blm banner some of the movements key activists and fellow travelers have become wellknown activists who met with barack obama at the white house in 2014 the movement achieved its biggest success last year when obama became the first sitting president to visit a federal prison in oklahoma and called for prison reform during a speech to the national association for the advancement of colored people much of these grassroots efforts have been emboldened by the justice department which under attorney generals eric holder and loretta lynch have negotiated consent decrees with the cities of ferguson and cleveland in the aftermath of the police shooting of 12yearold tamir rice and ushered in federal prison reform for juveniles and new rehabilitation and reentry programs for inmates however backlash against the blm started almost as soon as it began like their civil rights predecessors who were painted as communists black lives matter activists have been smeared as violent antipolice hooligans and thugs hashtags such as bluelivesmatter have been utilized by conservatives not only as a shield against needed reform but also to bolster a narrative that law enforcement represents a real and metaphorical wall preserving civilization from the darkskinned barbarians at the gate this narrative ignores the devastating impact of federal criminal justice policy and the drug war on the black community over the past halfcentury national criminal justice policy dates back to the great society programs of the 1960s and provided the federal government with new resources to distribute to states to reduce crime by the 1970s then new york governor nelson rockefeller enacted punitive sentencing  including mandatory minimums for minor drug offenses  that would become enshrined in national law during the reagan revolution of the 1980s that era amplified a drug war initially launched by richard nixon and one that barely contained its antiblack racial impulses the cumulative effect of crime policies across the us were to criminalize black offenders through ostensibly colorblind policy that targeted the exact kinds of crimes more likely to be found in chocolate cities than vanilla suburbs by the 1990s the young bill clinton enacted welfare reform and a crime bill that fed on darker impulses categorizing young black juveniles as superpredators stripping exoffender of access to public housing food stamps and the ability to reunite with family including children virtually assuring hopeless futures for generations of predominantly poor and workingclass black women and men this is the larger context for the unfolding tragedies that culminated in the shock and horror witnessed in dallas neither peaceful activists nor heroic police officers deserve to be scapegoated and blamed for the actions of rogue cops or mentally ill vigilantes the larger responsibility rests with american civil society its citizens politicians thought leaders and activists america remains the most powerful nation on earth the inability to forcefully confront the current crisis of race and democracy makes us appear smaller than we are we can find a way to protect black lives and the lives of law enforcement and first responders if we make this a priority we must understand why everyday black humanity is denigrated and demonized proactive policy steps are needed to end this deep inequality one whose reverberations continue to haunt american democracys very soul more comment topics black
