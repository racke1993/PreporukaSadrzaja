film industry disaster looms if british film disconnects from europe says studio head chief executive of studiocanal uk frenchowned british ministudio says without eu support uk film industry could unravel it counteracts the idea you have to put walls up  paddington photograph allstarstudiocanal andrew pulver andrewpulver saturday 9 july 2016 0027bst last modified on saturday 9 july 2016 0130bst share on facebook share on twitter share via email share on linkedin share on google share on whatsapp share on messenger it is vital that british films retain their identity as european in the wake of the uks withdrawal from the eu according to the ceo of studiocanal uk the influential ministudio owned by french entertainment conglomerate canal plus danny perkins whose company has played a key role in getting films as varied as paddington legend and carol off the ground says that while brexit will just make everything more difficult retention of the socalled european certificate will mitigate the worst effects its a core issue for me says perkins qualifying as european content has an impact on the value of our films especially in regard to french and german tv theres a precedent switzerland is outside the eu but its films qualify as european after the two years of negotiation for brexit its vital for the uk that its film content counts as european sorry your browser is unable to play this video facebook twitter pinterest shaun the sheep movie video review perkins is well positioned to assess what the unravelling of the uks position in the eu will mean in practical terms studiocanal uk is quietly celebrating its 10year anniversary  dating from the 2006 acquisition of independent distributor optimum releasing by the french film giants studiocanal canal plus production arm  and in that time have become the leading nonhollywood studio in the uk their move into production with 2010s brighton rock has seen them steadily accrue success culminating in paddingtons stellar performance in 2014 and the subsequent greenlighting of a sequel paddington 2 anything you are looking to acquire has become 1015 more expensive anything we are looking to invest in our contribution is suddenly 1015 less the uks postbrexit vote currency crash affecting both dollars and euros has seen to that the european qualification says perkins is vital to penetrate markets where hollywood with its allconsuming output deals has consistently dominated for any of us in the business of exporting british content its going to be harder because i dont think anyone is warming to us right now culturally we have just given two fingers to the rest of europe related how paddington took paul king from mighty boosh to almighty blockbuster perkins concerns are part of the mosaic of brexitrelated crises engulfing the british film world which  just like other cosmopolitan trade sectors  is still grappling with the changes that lie ahead once article 50 is invoked not only will funding from eu agencies dry up meaning european films will struggle to find berths in uk cinemas and british producers will find it more difficult to place their films abroad but the system of european coproduction treaties that enable british producers to find backing for their films will have to be scrapped and renegotiated usbased producers appear chipper about stepping into fill the gap  but their priorities are likely to be very different from the europeans and less interested in helping british filmmakers concerned with the uks cultural identity however to some extent perkins can keep studiocanal uks head above the fray insulated as they are by their parent organisation we are fortunate he says that we are part of a big international company so we can manage our operations around the legislation that lies ahead if we were still an independent outfit it would be a lot tougher restrictions on freedom of movement will hamper the exchange of staff between the companys various national outposts and red tape will vastly increase its a huge opportunity if youre in the bureaucracy business says perkins whoever prints passports is going to do really well studiocanals relatively recent foray into the familyfilm market  which saw their success with paddington repeated with shaun the sheep movie in 2015 an aardman production which they financed  may also provide some insulation from brexitshock given that films which perform well globally are not so dependent on european support the irony that these successes have been achieved with very british material  and in paddingtons case incorporating a hymn to migrant inclusivity  is not lost in perkins you can have big successes locally but where things gets really interesting is if you have an international success it actually counteracts the idea you have to put walls up facebook twitter pinterest teddierose mallesonallen centre who plays tatty on the set of swallows and amazons photograph mcpixrex shutterstock paddingtons impressive numbers mean that perkins is now in the franchise business with a third film lined up after recently purchasing all intellectual property rights to the fluffy bear  something unthoughtof in the optimum releasing days when the company concentrated on arthouse and speciality films the film marked a seachange for the company the second biggest nonhollywood family film of all time after spirited away their next tilt at the market is another britnostalgia piece an adaptation of arthur ransomes novel swallows and amazons and are again as with paddington finding out that adapting a beloved classic is not without its risks the normally mildmannered perkins expresses a degree of exasperation over the tittytatty row  and rolls his eyes at the memory of the string of pr challenges in the runup to paddingtons release everything that could have gone wrong went wrong he says including colin firths unavoidably public dropout the creepy paddington meme an embarrassing row with the bbfc over the films mild sex references but as far as brexit goes pekins is phlegmatic it amplifies the problems that are already there the big films do proportionally better but there are less of them doing that the cinemas are owned by venture capitalists and they wont make their money by playing a wide range of films its tougher than ever for small films to get on screen and tougher to hold on to that screen perkins says the arrival of netflix and amazon are good news for indies  they never had any money out of pay tv so its a decent safety net that has helped to make up for the decline of dvd but some of the problems the film world faces are simple to get people out of the house when tv has upped its game tv is better than its ever been so motivating people to go and see a film is harder than ever brexit has made everything 10 tougher but its the 10 that could make a big difference more news topics film industry paddington shaun the sheep movie animation european union europe
