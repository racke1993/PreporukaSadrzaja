on messenger you wait 26 years for another female tory leader and then two candidates come along at once between margaret thatchers resignation in 1990 and david cameron coming to power in 2005 the conservatives had seen six leadership elections featuring 14 candidates with not a single woman to be found on the ballot yet here we are in 2016 with theresa may and andrea leadsom fighting it out not just for party leadership but for the keys to no 10 too related in andrea leadsom the tories may have another formidable thatcher much has been made of the fact that for all its talk of feminism and equality the left has returned a grand total of zero female prime ministers in comparison to what will become the conservatives two those on the right and centre who usually cling desperately to an apolitical feminism magically detached from societys structures suddenly see politics as relevant again now the conservatives are the real feminists isnt it funny how those who harp on about gender equality have never managed the same level of success precisely because feminism cannot be divorced from the politics that render it necessary the question of why the right  on paper at least  is better at womens representation is one worth asking what is the secret to its success is it a strong commitment from leadership to equal representation a particularly good mentoring and coaching initiative positive action strategies not according to the evidence despite their hitrate on female prime ministers women make up just 20 of the conservatives parliamentary members compared to labours 44 allwomen shortlists and genderbalanced candidate lists favoured by labour and the green party are shunned by the tories a few lucky women have made it to the top although fewer than probably should have done if we really did live in the meritocracy the tories love so dearly but did they fight their way there against the odds forcing political structures to change to accommodate women no they took the same shape as the male leaders before them in order to fit the mould  antiwomen policy positions included take may already lauded by commentators as a pioneer for womens equality a muchneeded sensible voice and a womans woman but this feminist icon lest we forget has backed devastating austerity cuts that have disproportionately hit women this social justice warrior has overseen the deportation of thousands of vulnerable women including those deemed not lesbian enough and this saviour of women has refused to reveal the extent of sexual abuse in the inhumane womens detention centre yarls wood for fear of harming commercial interests if feminist progress is measured in deeds not words as the suffragettes said mays speak louder indeed related however unfair female politicians must still face the gender thing  anne perkins and yet it is these deeds that win elections in a social order reliant on the continued subordination of women it is unsurprising that a party that promises to sustain it will come out on top regardless of the leaders gender thatcher and may confirm all the stereotypes about women in politics that keep the electorate comfortable hardnosed sharpdressing businesslike there on merit disproving that leftie nonsense about women needing special treatment they might be women but the sexist status quo is safe in their hands the question then becomes whether representation alone is a marker of feminist success its undeniable that its harder for women in general to make it to the top  a truly equal political system would surely see just as many incompetent women elected as there are men after all  but its also true that women are not a homogeneous group those it is harder for still dont fit the mould of a steely white rightwing woman with the interests of the privileged at heart may might smash a glass ceiling in a moment of personal achievement but the ruthless rightwing policies she will inflict on the country will ensure that it is fully repaired and back in place by the end of her term the feminist success of conservative women leaders is something of a smokescreen reassuring as it may be to celebrate individual women leaders as beacons of progress the fact remains that they benefit few but themselves in a country so entrenched in inequality its no coincidence that our female leaders have come from the right with an inherently sexist ideology of individualism and meritocracy its that very inequality that ensures the system doesnt fit women leaders of any other ilk so its true that the conservatives might well be winning the race when it comes to female prime ministers but feminist ones were not yet out of the starting blocks more comment topics conservatives feminism theresa may
