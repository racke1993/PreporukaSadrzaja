facebook share on twitter share via email share on linkedin share on google share on whatsapp share on messenger after 30 days 50 games 107 goals 5000 kilometres run and several distinct phases of inertia and intrigue euro 2016 has its final it is the right final too if didier deschamps team could get there france against someone else always looked the right way to end these warily embraced championships staged by a willing if slightly weary host a nation still in a state of official emergency after a bloody and fretful year the cracks have showed at times but not often and less so with every passing round in marseille on thursday night birthplace of the original march on paris there was something genuinely cheering in the spectacle of 45000 french with relief as well as pageantry in the air cheering their team off to the stade de france there is a tendency to find some rather glib simplifications in the spectacle of sport to swallow the idea that these gaudy formalities can provide a lasting balm for the bruises of the real world midway through this tournament there was even a creeping suggestion that the twoweek summer holiday jaunts of a few thousand irish and welsh could somehow heal the scars of paris uniting a nation behind the power of craic the celts have gone home now but france still faces strikes paranoia soldiers on the streets and potentially grisly elections next year related france one win from euro 2016 final six years after disgrace of south africa  amy lawrence and yet there is a place for sport here the show rolls on there will be a party in paris on sunday night and the chance for a little ceremonial communion is a genuinely alluring prospect france will be favourites and they would be popular winners too even their stodgy start in the same venue a month ago ended with dimitri payet the boy from runion producing a spectacular galvanising winning goal they have been the most compelling team at this tournament there are other intriguing aspects to this france team not least the mix of veteran and youthful talents and the inspiring sporting backstories of many of the players from ngolo kants rise from ligue 2 via leicester to the decisive presence of the itinerant antoine griezmann plus of course griezmann brings his own more disturbing backstory to paris there is no obvious meaning no easy moral to be drawn from the fact griezmanns elder sister maud was a survivor of the bataclan attacks last november on the same night france were playing germany across town the temptation will be to see some circular note of defiance a borrowed significance in what is essentially a coincidence one small part of a traumatic story tacked on to the simplicities of sport still though it is impossible not to be moved by the prospect the echoes are unavoidably there and the stade de france promises to be a febrile place on sunday night for reasons that go beyond football there is of course another team involved portugal are also deserving finalists as all finalists are their progress has been tenacious rather than thrilling and there will be a temptation to cast these teams in contrasting lights one thought occurs given frances emotional weight what an opportunity this is for cristiano ronaldo to make an absolute public villain of himself undeserved no doubt but a glorious infamy is a scuffedpenalty 10 win away related france get final wish after antoine griezmanns double sinks germany it is a peculiar feature of portugals run that ronaldo the teams captain and totem has been portrayed by many as the ultimate sporting egotist the oppositions are already forming before this final heroes versus hair gel libert galit fraternit versus me myself and i the needs of the many against shouting at nani this is to misunderstand the nature of sport and also to belittle portugals achievement there are still some excellent contrasts between the two finalists in ronaldo and paul pogba the stade de france will host what looks like european footballs present against its future portugal have a nagging slightly fussy style whereas france like to strike quickly and with elan in textural terms this could yet pan out as portugals light drizzle against frances violent hailstorms plus portugal are the clear underdog a nation of 10 million that has overachieved consistently against the hosts twotimes champions and the de facto cradle of the uefazone game beyond this there are also plenty of similarities as the smaller nations progressed through this tournament there was cautious talk of a leicester effect of some unlikely winner emerging france and portugal are not this but there is an unusually homemade underdogish feel to both groups of players related cristiano ronaldo is like the revenant selfbelief that just wont die  rob smyth portugal may have a star but their most notable quality is that willing team spirt to a degree this is a group of survivors from the highprofile but still relatively unfulfilled careers of ricardo quaresma and nani to the lateblooming success of jos fonte they are a gritty bunch never mind the ronaldoaslonepopstar theory portugals success here is a tribute to spirit and tactical intelligence france also have a mixed group half the first team have taken angular zigzagging journeys to this spot griezmann payet kant olivier giroud and laurent koscielny thrived outside the elite academy system and were capped relatively late most teams are more random than they first look but there is a point of contrast here against for example a world cup final in brazil that brought a meeting of two golden crops from germany and argentina france and portugal are also two of the great export powers of european club football a kitchen garden of the champions league set france exports more players than any european nation with portugal not far behind relative to size all but a tiny handful of the starters will have been playing abroad before the age of 25 their success is a tribute to the fecund functioning youth structure of both nations and to the benefits of travel and wider experience griezmann crops up again here european footballs schengen area poster boy whose formative years were removed from france where he is still to play a club match at any level it seems likely griezmann will again play close to giroud from where he has been a beautifully balanced mobile cutting edge portugal will hope pepe recovers in time for france the key is getting the balance in midfield right the power and craft of pogba and blaise matuidi have been evident only intermittently against germany the absence of kant was felt similarly portugal will look to strengthen their own midfield william carvalho is available again how effectively that midfield can close the spaces in front of the defence could be key france are not just the emotional choice to win this final for all portugals qualities the hosts look stronger in almost every area with greater peaks of talent and greater thrust in their attacking play ronaldo remains the obvious variable but france have what feels like a winning momentum a team driven on rather than dragged down by hosting a tournament with its own burdens its own peculiar noises off more features topics euro 2016 france portugal share on facebook share on twitter share via email share on
