stars  says who my trouble with tripadvisor ever been fooled by a rave restaurant review marina oloughlin has  and thats just the start of her problems with the site a huge number of otherwise sensible people give credence to the aggregated opinion of at best unqualified strangers photograph alamy marina oloughlin marinaoloughlin friday 8 july 2016 1400bst last modified on saturday 9 july 2016 0005bst share on facebook share on twitter share via email share on linkedin share on google share on whatsapp share on messenger it was in a small seaside town in croatia that my dislike of tripadvisor petrified into loathing the sites top listing wasnt one of the adhoc shacks down by the beach that sold the freshest fish grilled over wood where my nose would have led me but we went along with it all the same never before or since have i eaten in a restaurant where our hosts fished the meal from a vast chest freezer in full view remember to write about us on tripadvisor they urged as we dolefully paid our bill giving us a free liqueur that tasted of cif and cynicism despite the fact that virtually every week brings a new story about how useless tripadvisor is how it enables users who are corruptgreedymendacious the site trundles on like a marauder spewing an everincreasing volume of freely given unpaid content as it has since its conception in 2000 despite all evidence to the contrary  in 2013 its ceo stephen kaufer pocketed more than 39m  tripadvisor has convinced its contributors that it is one of us like a digital version of nigel farage or donald trump regardless of the fact that it is riddled with fakes and idiots a huge number of otherwise sensible people continue to give credence to the aggregated opinion of at best unqualified strangers a 2015 governmentbacked competitions  markets authority investigation found that uk consumers spend more than 23bn a year after reading online reviews only a very small proportion of respondents felt that it was not very likely or not at all likely that the reviews were written by genuine customers the report concluded the manchester top 10 proves its not fit for purpose i dont see how it could help a newcomer get a feel for the city personally i dont hate tripadvisor because of the bullyboy tactics or rapaciousness with which it is associated i dont hate it because it enables reviews of and tickets for cruel animal attractions or for its climate of blackmailenabling entitlement i hate it because its shit at the time of writing the top restaurants in glasgow and manchester are respectively a bogstandard chicken tikka masalapunting indian and a fairly obnoxious americanstyle joint topping the london list is an upscale outfit described by my informed critic counterparts as ploughing through stubble and foam and fine dine like its 1999 followed by an averagelooking french restaurant in battersea with an idiotic portmanteau name none of these in my considered and yep sorry expert opinion is worth crossing the road for let alone town although there is comedy in the fact that an irish caff in greenwich is ranked more highly than restaurant gordon ramsay i hate the implicit pressure on small businesses to sign up or pay the price to put buttons on websites and stickers on doors the fact that even the inadvertent user is bulldozed into downloading the wretched bloody app i hate tripadvisor because the top listing in one italian town was utterly fictitious because it gives awards to hotels like the tunisian one closed months earlier after 38 holidaymakers were shot dead because there is a whole industry dedicated to churning out fake bytheyard reviews as the american travel journalist heather stimmlerhall has noted tripadvisor once proudly announced itself as the worlds most trusted travel site this trademark quietly shuffled away in 2013 possibly something to do with a wave of lawsuits and a ruling by the british advertising standards authority that the site was not to claim or imply that all the reviews that appeared on the website were from real travellers or were honest real or trusted the unfortunate corollary of this is that tripadvisor cant now be held accountable for what it describes as a few fake reviews win reading many of the reviews i have a mental image of a hybrid of hyacinth bucket and vizs mr logic and thats just the real ones a few weeks ago a contributor called madeupreviews submitted a review of a greasy spoon in reading that kicked off with i heard about this fine restaurant from a chap at the veg section of lidl who is kind enough to allow me to flagellate myself with a marrow once a month at the time of writing its still there it took a while for the powers that be to figure out that the many reviews of the grand budapest hotel might prove problematic for hopeful travellers no it doesnt exist there is now a matey disclaimer that suggests they were always in on the joke or reviews of a halfway house for asylum seekers in cardiff if you are travelling far perhaps in the back of a cross channel truck or a boat across the med then this is a lovely place to stay facebook twitter pinterest please dont mistake this for the frustrated bleatings of a dead tree media fossil threatened by the onslaught of citizen journalism photograph alamy gary usher chef and owner of restaurants sticky walnut in chester and burnt truffle in the wirral has been vocal on social media about his own dislike of the site and has tested the system himself last week i wrote a spoof review the manager ate my dawg to highlight that their supposed fraud prevention is not fit for purpose i purposely included tripadvisor in my many tweets telling them what i was doing while my review was pending i was awarded 200 points and a badge thom hetherington ceo of manchesters northern restaurant  bar exhibition agrees sadly the manchester top 10 proves its not fit for purpose the list smacks of being driven by writeups submitted with a variety of possibly questionable motivations and i dont see how it could possibly help a newcomer to get a true feel for the city my observer colleague jay rayner has lent his voice to the noreceiptnoreview campaign designed to help counteract the proliferation of fake reviews users are asked not to post without a scanned receipt  to prove they were there and that they paid we all know that tripadvisor is an echo chamber for the sound of axes grinding rayner tells me so it doesnt even function well as a site for basic information i used to consult it to get a list of possible restaurants in a city i didnt know well paying no attention to the reviews for exeter the tripadvisor top 30 included the branch of mcdonalds on the ring road exeter deserves better if it doesnt even function as a source of basic information whats the point the noreceiptnoreview initiative was launched by undercover british food inspector tom tomeats on twitter in a quest for greater transparency and yes i do see the irony in his anonymity but such is the juggernaut quality of tripadvisor for those working in the hospitality industry i felt terrible for business owners faced with fictitious reviews they were powerless to address he says hiding behind the legal protection of merely displaying the opinions of others as opposed to actually having any of its own tripadvisor is a brick wall to owners who havent asked to be listed yet cannot be delisted they should have the right to know anything written about them is derived from a real proven stay or meal how has tripadvisor reacted their responses have focused on how hard it would be for example for a table of four to be able to post four reviews with only one receipt tom thinks that tripadvisor will be damaged by the campaign but unable or unwilling to do anything about it their armslength wedontneedyou stance with owners is creating a festering dislike that is filtering out into the wider restaurantgoing community and mainstream press the owl is becoming a signpost for fakery comedy and mistrust rather than an authority the thing i hate most is seeing staff being insulted and having their names put in a bad light online people whose lives and businesses have been damaged by the sites cavalier approach to factchecking are also taking matters into their own hands with sites such as tripadvisordestroyscom demanding user verification and twitter accounts tripadvisorsham and tripadwarning regularly updating with new evidence of chicanery i ask david the man behind tripadvisorsham whats his beef he tells me most of the vitriol i hear concerns the inability to get fakes removed reviews written by competitors or disgruntled exstaff ive been caught up in this myself what about tripadvisors muchtrumpeted commitment to weeding them out hes not buying it they claim to have advanced proprietary systems to spot fakes but how can this actually work they wont disclose the techniques because we might game them very convenient and fakes do affect rankings the ranking system is a joke then theres the blackmail independent businesses threatened by users with the big stick of a bad tripadvisor review in order to score discounts and free meals small restaurants with bottom lines that live or die by a few tables a week are wearily resigned to it they cant afford court cases when the site is deaf to their entreaties tripadvisor describes blackmail as an occasional concern and encourages restaurants to report it before anything is posted but as david says their blackmailreporting feature is useless it relies on us knowing blackmailers names and expects them to review under those names its laughable gary usher tells me what its like to be on the receiving end the thing i hate most is seeing staff being insulted and having their names put in a bad light online they have no right of reply i also find that the reviewers who mention the team in this way were the rudest of guests funny that please dont mistake this for the frustrated bleatings of a dead tree media fossil threatened by the mighty onslaught of citizen journalism for one thing i am writing this from the perspective of a punter not a pundit for another while i welcome many voices this internet clamour isnt turning us into a democratic utopia but rather something that resembles the film idiocracy in which a man wakes up after 500 years in a world of well idiots im not against the idea of a source of unbiased factchecked crowdsourced wisdom but tripadvisor aint that with gems such as i recoment the lasange and the great fist and chips or men telling us what the lady wife made of the loos everyone just isnt a critic but its good for hotels you might say well up to a point it is good for hotels that have buckled to customers attempts at extortion not so much for the small independents who would rather not shell out nor am i interested in the idea that if you spend enough time on tripadvisor youre able to fossick out the sane sensible voices from the loons shills and people whove incubated a grievance after inadvertently shagging the chef when travelling now i do hit the internet finding fellow food writers and local experts on instagram and twitter and always benefiting from their generous advice and in the absence of trusted voices ill do what i used to do follow my nose unlike tripadvisor it rarely leads me wrong who knows i might just rebrand it the worlds most trusted nose bung it online then lie back and count the money more features topics tripadvisor summer
