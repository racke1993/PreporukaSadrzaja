invited to continue his underdog bid for the white house by the green partys probable presidential candidate who has offered to step aside to let him run jill stein who is expected to be endorsed at the partys august convention in houston told guardian us that overwhelming numbers of sanders supporters are flocking to the greens rather than hillary clinton stein insisted that her presidential bid has a viable near term goal of reaching 15 in national polling which would enable her to stand alongside presumptive nominees clinton and donald trump in televised election debates but in a potentially destabilising move for the democratic party and an exciting one for sanders supporters the green party candidate said she was willing to stand aside for sanders ive invited bernie to sit down explore collaboration  everything is on the table she said if he saw that you cant have a revolutionary campaign in a counterrevolutionary party hed be welcomed to the green party he could lead the ticket and build a political movement she said stein said she had made her offer directly to sanders in an email at the end of the primary season although she had not received a response her surprise intervention comes amid speculation that sanders will finally draw a line under a bruising democratic contest by endorsing clintons presidential bid next week if he continues to declare his full faith in the democratic party it will leave many of his supporters very disappointed she said that political movement is going to go on  it isnt going to bury itself in the graveyard alongside hillary clinton stein said the democratic establishment had conducted psychological warfare against sanders and sabotaged his attempts to gain the partys presidential nomination many of his young progressive supporters are now moving over to the green party rather than fall in behind clinton stein added im not holding my breath but im not ruling it out that we can bring out 43 million young people into this election she said its been a wild election every rule in the playbook has been tossed out unfortunately that has mainly been used to lift up hateful demagogues like donald trump but it can also be done in a way that actually answers peoples needs stein a former massachusetts doctor turned environmental activist is attempting to woo young voters with a promise to make college free and beyond what sanders has pledged to cancel all existing student debt through quantitive easing with a more ambitious climate change policy stein favors getting to 100 renewablepowered electricity by the middle of the century and a less interventionist approach to foreign affairs than clinton the greens have also pitched at voters who have been dubbed as being bernie or bust however stein still faces an uphill battle to reach the 15 in polling that would give her a spot in the televised debates she may not even secure the 5 that would give the green party federal funding in the next election stein who secured nearly 470000 votes as the green party candidate in 2012 is currently polling between 4 and 6 almost nine out of 10 voters dont know enough about stein in order to pass judgment on her leftwing stances and polling conducted for the guardian has shown that a large chunk of sanders base is prepared to back clinton if as expected she is confirmed as the democratic nominee the veteran political scientist larry sabato of the university of virginias center for politics said he expected most sanders voters to rally to clinton facebook twitter pinterest bernie sanders on capitol hill last month photograph cliff owenap the polarization well see in the fall will be as intense as weve ever seen he said itll push the right to trump and the left to clinton youll see consolidation especially on the democratic side  the idea of trump as president will make anyone even slightly left of center vote for clinton jill stein will get some of the bernie voters but hillary will get most not because people love hillary but because they hate trump the green party vote wont have much an influence unless its a squeaker like in 2000 when ralph nader got 29m votes for the green party and george w bush became president but a lot of democratic voters remember what happened then but stein who unsuccessfully challenged mitt romney to be governor of massachusetts in 2002 said clintons policies made her unsavory to many young people she is the fracking queen stein said we would be fools to expect hillary to deal with the climate crisis  the day of reckoning will come closer with her as president as scary as trump talks hillary has a scary record for warmongering and the neoliberalism its a mistake to think the lesser of two evils will fix things a lot of people are in the target hairs of a neoliberalist nightmare wars are bankrupting us morally and financially at least when republicans are elected people fight  when democrats are elected people are lulled into complacency and fall asleep while the green party has had members elected to several us state legislatures the party has never made inroads into federal politics this is in contrast with sister green parties in the uk which has a member of parliament australia where the greens have been part of government and austria where a former green was recently elected president stein said this was because the us had a voting system designed to suppress opposition a switch to a different model is highly unlikely however particularly in the near term since the republicans were established in the 1880s we havent had a third party become a major party said sabato if we had a parliamentary system the greens would have representation but that is scheduled to happen on the 12th of never more news
