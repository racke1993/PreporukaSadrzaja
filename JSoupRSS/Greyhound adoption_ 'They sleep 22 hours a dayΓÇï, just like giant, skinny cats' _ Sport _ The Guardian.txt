greyhound ownership to guardian australia adopting a greyhound most australian states have a branch of the greyhound adoption program gap an organisation set up to match retired runners to new homes the dogs are usually fostered out to an experienced greyhound home first two of the eight currently competing for space in front of the fire at the grahams are foster dogs to get used to civilised behaviour  eve gibson eveegibson july 8 2016 mjrowland68 breakfastnews as owner of 2 rescued greyhounds couldnt be happier both taken to be put down age 2  pictwittercomzljnfvhohq they also allow

corio in geelong on sunday as the ban comes into force expect to see more dogs available through gap nsw and the rspca they will need a muzzle and they cant go offlead with the exception of victoria and the northern territory which allow certified dogs adopted through the gap to go muzzlefree greyhounds must be muzzled in public in australia the law was introduced in the 1970s to protect valuable racing dogs from each other but the rspca is lobbying to have it repealed related greyhound races suspended with industry in shock over nsw shutdown it is against the law throughout australia to let your greyhound offlead in a public place lest they see something running greyhounds are sighthounds which means they take off after fastmoving quarry including other dogs and cats once theyre off graham said you cant call them back theyll focus on the chase to the exclusion off everything else including roads fences and other hazards its just as likely theyll come a cropper as catch their quarry so the lead is for their benefit as well all they need to see is a kite flying or a cat or small dog running and they will chase graham said they will forget what they are doing and just run some greyhound clubs let pet owners use their facilities to let their dogs have a run but graham said that even in those supervised jaunts the potential for injury is high greyhounds have very thin skin and it tears like paper they are not big walkers luckily graham said greyhounds do not seem to miss running you hear of the odd person who says they got a greyhound that likes to run for an hour a day but most are just lazy she said ours go for a 20 minute walk  not a fast walk mind  three times a week they are not big walkers even at the track they only run for a few minutes and then they go back to their kennel and get a hose down and go back to their trailer to sleep most greyhound adoption agencies recommend a daily 20 minute walk cats children and other variables greyhounds are generally fine with cats unless the cat runs away which is to say they are not fine with cats adoption agencies usually advise if a dog has been tested by a cat as graham put it and is therefore safe for feline companionship even if a greyhound is calm around a cat inside the house she said they could give chase outdoors its that sighthound autopilot again greyhounds are safe with children but they may find them overwhelming they being the dogs graham said again adoption agencies mark those hardy enough to stand up to small kids the western australian branch of gap said they have an uncanny love of children which manifests in most greyhounds as a tendency to lean against the object of their affection until they get a hug you might end up with a pack grahams house is a network of dog beds and babygates with a permanent breeze from the back door being left ajar and very little free space on the couch theres prinny or princess the youngest then bailey toby kobi nugget and koshi plus fosters sandy and princess the elder she concedes she has amassed something of a pack but said a group of greyhounds was a much calmer affair than a group of any other breed of dog its just a large elegant yawn in mismatched turtlenecks we just cant stop she said were just besotted they are very calm and clean i would never have this many of any other breed of dogs especially little yappy dogs living in the same house but they just entertain themselves while its not necessary to have a neat halfdozen most adoption agencies do recommend your greyhound have at least one other canine friend and those turtlenecks ridiculous though they may look are not optional their short coats and low bodyfat leave them very vulnerable to changes in temperature for more information on greyhound adoption
