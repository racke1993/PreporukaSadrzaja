words ever can the scenes that greeted us when we arrived in reykjavik on monday only a few hours after our quarterfinal against france had finished will stay with me forever as we drove the 40 minutes from the airport to the city centre huge numbers of people lined the streets and then finishing up on arnarholl thousands more awaited us you could only feel intensely overwhelmingly proud the speeches we heard from our president prime minister and others would have softened any heart and brought home the scale of what our boys did this summer none of us could ever for a single moment have envisaged the reception we were given sorry your browser is unable to play this video facebook twitter pinterest iceland team given heroes welcome in reykjavik on return from euro 2016 the players are now legends in the eyes of icelands people they will be remembered in the same way england venerates its world cup winners from 1966 they have given the currency of our football a huge boost and it will extend beyond sport too as a wonderful advertisement for a country that is now on the map like never before soon i will sit down with my staff and other members of the icelandic fa to look with the benefit of distance at how we achieved what we did at euro 2016  what was good and what was not so good maybe we will examine how we exited the tournament with the france game getting away from us so early and wonder whether the mental impact of beating england contributed perhaps the players got overexcited after that and however hard they tried could not quite focus from zero again  it happens because everyone is human but the positives will dominate our success owed much to a gradual tangible increase in belief the first group game against portugal was absolutely critical they were better than us but we restricted them to just one goal and then when birkir bjarnason equalised after halftime we got ourselves back into it psychologically that was a key factor in everything that followed it was a point against the best team in the group and the players took heart from then on i felt we played better and better in each game the confidence growing even as the hurdles got taller negotiating every challenge until that first half against france related icelands beautiful journey finally comes to an end at euro 2016  barney ronay playing the same starting xi in all five games  something i dont believe had happened before at a european championship  also made a difference when you know how the teammate next to you is playing have worked alongside him and seen him grow during the tournament it can work wonders  particularly when you are an underdog it is a credit to our medical staff and also to a team of such remarkably strong characters that they all made it so far and perhaps they suffered a little by the time we played france we did not bring a big scientific entourage with us and rarely carried out extensive tests on the players so there may have been a fatigue factor then again they roused themselves to play superbly in the second half and that is another testament to their attitude i said before the england game that victory would change everyones lives and my opinion has not changed after such a remarkable night the most obvious consequence will be that many of the players join bigger clubs we managed to keep a few possible deals beneath the radar during the tournament and hopefully we will now see several of the guys profiles increase more generally people will take us with complete seriousness now there was a sense at times that we were made fun of in the past  we have a small population the coach is a dentist things like that  but i cannot see that happening any more our football now has a clear identity we have found a way to win football matches using our players specific qualities and by getting everything out of them if there have been a few questions about our style i would answer by saying that if we attempted to play like spain we would only ever be a bad replica of them when we could we showed the quality of football we can play we are comfortable with who we are and the task is now to make it work for years into the future icelanders are demanding  we will now be expected to qualify for every major tournament there will not be too many changes on the pitch as we approach the world cup qualifiers we are lucky that most of these players are of a good age and few will step out of the squad in the next two or three years related iceland fans on euro 2016 its turning into a nationwide romance  were in love even though some of our younger players did not play much in france it was fascinating to see how they grew within the squad in a tournament environment and that bodes well the main alteration will be that lars lagerback my comanager has stepped down his contribution to icelandic football will never ever be forgotten and the relationship we have with him will be enduring he is more than a colleague to me  we are close friends and i know he will be coming back to watch games in reykjavik before we begin planning for russia 2018 this story needs an end of its own on sunday night i will be at the stade de france where we felt so many emotions a week ago to watch the final my wife and i have spent the last couple of days in annecy the beautiful alpine town we were based at during the tournament in fact i would say the location was one of the main factors in our success it felt like home for everyone and thats a big factor when you have a squad of 23 all staying together for so long some of whom may be frustrated at not playing the atmosphere helped drive everyone along and when my family and i return for holidays in future years the feelings will all come back the experience we have all been through has been a rollercoaster  each and every game we tackled it as we always do with positivity and optimism if you harness those qualities then you have a chance whatever your circumstances and i hope we showed that in france as told to nick ames more features topics iceland euro 2016 share on facebook share on twitter share via email share on linkedin share on google share on whatsapp
