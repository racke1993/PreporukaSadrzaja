on facebook share on twitter share via email share on linkedin share on google share on whatsapp share on messenger in 1996 when isabella rossellini was about to turn 44 she was sacked after 14 years as the face and spokesperson of lancme cosmetics she was told in no uncertain terms that she was past it beauty advertising was about the dream executives told her not the harsh reality and women dreamed about being young the actors face would soon become an unwelcome reminder of the ageing process and so despite rossellinis insistence that eternal youth was neither her dream nor that of any woman she knew she says she told lancme that the new dream was to be independent to be powerful to assert yourself  she was replaced rather humiliatingly by the very similarlooking juliette binoche  dark hair pale skin full lips high cheekbones  only 12 years her junior heartbroken at the prospect of losing her job her main source of income and a second family of colleagues the mother of two asked a senior executive what she was supposed to do next he said rossellini recalls i am not your wet nurse it was pretty rough no doubt it was hard she says now as we sit in a grand flowerfilled room at the scene of the crime lancmes hq in paris where at 64 isabella rossellini is all smiles and once again the star attraction my daughter was 10 and my son was one and i was a single mum i cried and was depressed and i worried financially as a fortysomething single mother of two myself i tell her i can well imagine what im struggling to understand is how when lancme called her just eight months ago to ask her to return to the fold rossellini didnt suggest they shove their mascara up their derriere and twist it the red carpet has become a job its like a beauty competition and everyone feels uncomfortable about it she is unfathomably magnanimous there was that feeling when a friend asked why i was going back she concedes i said because im flattered im very touched i miss them its very personal but i dont know whether im being forgiving rossellini says the company from which she was ejected is now very different when i was here 20 years ago the secretaries were women and the bosses were men the industry was one of men creating products on the understanding that makeup was for seduction she says but i put makeup on even if i go out with my sister  there is a pleasure in the gesture i was not understood significantly the brands ceo is now a woman franoise lehmann and it was she who made the recent call having launched campaigns fronted by penlope cruz and lupita nyongo she felt it was high time lancme celebrated older age too as rossellini explains  last year lancme turned 80 and we were thinking what was life like for women 80 years ago they couldnt vote or own their own apartment  its incredible we wanted to reflect the emancipation of women that has been so strong in our century facebook twitter pinterest ingrid bergman and roberto rossellini with ingrid roberto jr isabella and renzo in 1953 photograph rex having been born into scandal rossellini had seen her own mother fall foul of sexism and double standards ingrid bergman met the director roberto rossellini on the set of stromboli fell in love and gave birth to his son while still married to her swedish husband petter lindstrom  the father of isabellas eldest sister pia despite a career as an oscar and tony awardwinning actor and perhaps because of her image as a modest graceful embodiment of womanhood bergman had just played joan of arc her success was eclipsed by her adultery in march 1950 in the wake of the affair and her subsequent marriage to rossellini bergman was denounced on the floor of us congress by senator edwin c johnson as a horrible example of womanhood and a powerful influence for evil she was he said an argument that actors should undergo background checks before being employed to entertain americans despite johnsons belief that out of ingrid bergmans ashes will grow a better hollywood the proposed bill proved unsuccessful but the controversy damaged her career and family life bergman temporarily lost custody of pia and retreated to the more forgiving european film industry she and rossellini later divorced sharing joint custody of their children roberto junior fouryearold isabella and her nonidentical twin sister ingrid an academic who teaches italian literature bergman remarried but rossellinis childhood remained complicated she and her siblings lived between new york paris and rome staying in hotels and apartments with a nanny her parents and stepparents taking it in turns to drop in and spend time with their seven collective children who were understandably close rossellinis trademark chipped tooth came when her 12yearold brother threw a telephone at her face bergman cried for three days but isabella decided to keep it facebook twitter pinterest with her mother ingrid bergman photograph rex shutterstock before reaching her teens rossellini spent six months bedridden and two years in a body cast to correct scoliosis or curvature of the spine she had no intention of following her mother into the film industry i come from a generation of women where though my mother was a famous actress and had a big career we always assumed in the family that she was gifted with an enormous talent  so she was an exception a freak the other women in the family might work they might not work  but most of all you are a good mother and you marry she was however determined to be financially independent from a young age her father scornful of money and commercialism had died with just 200 in his bank account while bergman had entrusted her own financial affairs to accountants and been repeatedly burnt my mother never ran her money it was intimidating for that generation women in my family always gave it to the men to take care of i did say to my mum that i was going to take control of my own money i had seen what happened if you dont at 25 while working as a television reporter rossellini was sent to interview martin scorsese who was promoting his film new york new york they hit it off began dating and got married the resulting exposure led to modelling offers and very soon rossellini was working with photographers such as richard avedon and bruce weber and appearing on the cover of vogue much she has said to scorseses annoyance facebook twitter pinterest with then husband martin scorsese in 1981 in new york photograph getty images despite this relatively late start in modelling i didnt know models were 14 rossellini once said lancmes contract made her the highestpaid model in the world when it came in 1982 in an ironic case of history repeating itself the contract contained a morality clause much like the contracts of the 1950s hollywood studio system this was soon somewhat scuppered when rossellini became pregnant by a modelling colleague while separated from though still technically married to scorsese later she would appear as a drag king in madonnas 1992 sex book to the consternation of lancme who worried that people would think she was gay given the pious morality imposed on her and her mother i wonder if rossellini ever reflects on how much weve progressed i have a feeling that its got worse she says my parents paid a very big price but they were unique nowadays theres paparazzi everywhere its also the organised celebrity thing  the red carpet has become a job sometimes we see the actors and we know their names but not necessarily the films they were in its not very appealing to me because i dont like to do red carpets its like a beauty competition and i think everyone feels uncomfortable about it a lot of actors are very shy people there are a few who like public attention but theyre a minority i think actors like to act and they like storytelling rossellini has often said she prefers modelling to acting which downplays her considerable talents she tells me modelling gave me the confidence to act both my parents were very famous so i was hesitant but modelling gave me the feeling that i could dare her iconic performance in blue velvet as the bereft mother and lounge singer enduring horrific abuse at the hands of dennis hoppers frank booth won her an independent spirit award in 1986 director david lynch originally wanted helen mirren for the role but rossellini persuaded him to give her a chance the pair went on to become a couple for six years facebook twitter pinterest with kyle maclachlan in blue velvet photograph rex wild at heart her next project with lynch won the 1990 palme dor at cannes and ironically just a year before leaving lancme shed starred in the critically acclaimed campfest death becomes her in which rossellinis character sells the secret of eternal youth to desperate ageing housewives in hollywood i wonder if given that role and the sacking from lancme soon afterwards she herself became insecure about her advancing years rossellini cheerfully insists she made a clear distinction between her professional and personal life when youre young there is so much pressure because you work you need money as you grow older the focus becomes clearer and clearer if you like nobody ever talks about that how wonderful it is to grow older they always talk about wrinkles but ageing is interesting wrinkles or no wrinkles despite implicit pressures within the film and beauty industries she has resisted plastic surgery as someone with an acute radar for even discreet work id stake my reputation on her appearance being entirely without intervention from either needle or knife in 2012 rossellini took part in the documentary about face supermodels then and now and said sometimes i wake up and think is this the new technology lets go and do the operation but most of the time i wake up and think is this the new feet binding is this the new way of being misogynist is this a new way to tell women theyre ugly is this a new way of telling women they should be this and this and you give standards that are impossible to be reached because the underlying problem is misogyny after 60 work comes back that was true for my mum and maggie smith and helen mirren are the hottest things on earth she is she tells me not interested in chasing perfection when people tell me you look so glamorous you look sophisticated or elegant its wonderful but when people say youre beautiful i find it a little condescending worse now because they say youre still beautiful in italian we say its a knife with both edges because i know that they mean it to please me but its almost like saying to a black woman youre not so dark you dont look so black i am old this is what 65 looks like she is irritated that her generation isnt better catered for there is no fashion for women my age im sorry to say she tugs at her lovely navy silk tunic this i designed myself because its impossible to find things that arent for just one type it has to be skinny or it has to be sexy  i dont know whats going on in fashion i point out that sleeves are as easy to find as black orchids exactly there are no sleeves i want sleeves you cant find them i wonder if it isnt old age that lancme and hollywood couldnt deal with but middle age geena davis michelle pfeiffer and holly hunter all big stars in the 1990s struggled to get good jobs in their 50s rossellini agrees my mum told me that there is no job for women between 45 and 60 because you are inbetween you are not young enough to play the young girl but you are also not old enough to play the matriarch the witch or grandmother so there is a period of 15 years where youre in limbo and they dont know how to hire you then after 60 a lot of work comes back that was true for my mum and you see maggie smith is the hottest thing on earth helen mirren is the hottest thing on earth then there is this gap rossellini fell right into it the film roles thinned out and while hardly in the wilderness postlancme she was forced to create her own opportunities she launched a shortlived but very good cosmetics line manifesto for women of all ages and skin colours she wrote and performed monologues made a documentary about her mother performed in plays offbroadway and took on fun projects like a cameo in friends as rosss dream woman she bought a small organic farm studied animal behaviour and conservation and trained guide dogs though she recently had to stop after some lead tugging caused her to fall and injure her back guide dogs are labradors and golden retrievers she explains i could have broken my back so i thought no more training big dogs so what i do now is whelp and its delightful like a dog doula exactly they send me pregnant mamas they have the puppies then i keep them for two months and distribute them to all the volunteers for guide dog training facebook twitter pinterest with her daughter elettra in 1985 photograph rex she had been happily retired from showbusiness for a year when she was offered a part in joy the romantic comedy starring jennifer lawrence and robert de niro best friend of scorsese with whom rossellini has remained close she stopped cashing her actors trade union pension cheques rejoined the workforce and in the wake of joys popularity was offered a judging gig on upcoming reality tv show master of photography and a role in a drama she still manages the farm all the people at the farm wondered where i was because i was travelling again for the moment i try to manage it all so well see how long it lasts this burst of work she says taking nothing for granted but she loves tv and thinks it more attractive a proposition for mature women  actors and viewers alike the theory i have is that the films making the most money are made for young males and thats why they are these big action films not because mature women dont like them but because we have a family to raise and so we work we are mothers we cook we are the caregivers  and we have careers so at night after dinner we cant go out and watch films she feels television streaming on netflix amazon and online boxed sets has opened up new and far more inclusive possibilities i think there will be a lot of actresses working again she smiles im doing a series called shut eye and first of all i never expected to be the lead in something again im a lead with other actors but i am a very very substantial part theres a whole new audience of mature people who can watch 45 minutes of television and then fall asleep so its very fragmented we dont have these big event series where you have the entire country watching but you have enough people to create many series tell many stories i wonder if rossellinis story as the model pastured middleaged woman and then back again is one she wishes she didnt have to tell or so generously forgive she smiles i feel that its a story and this is the last chapter its a happy ending more
