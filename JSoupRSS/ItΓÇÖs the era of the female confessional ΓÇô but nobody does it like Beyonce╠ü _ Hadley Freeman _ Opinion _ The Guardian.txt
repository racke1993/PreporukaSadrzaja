of the female confessional  but nobody does it like beyonc hadley freeman i resent the idea that women should use their personal lives in their work so i should have hated seeing her live i did not beyonc live in the uk photograph daniela vescoinvision for parkwood entertainment contact author hadleyfreeman saturday 9 july 2016 0900bst share on facebook share on twitter share via email share on linkedin share on google share on whatsapp share on messenger i saw beyonc at wembley last weekend and while i dont want to overstate the issue it would be fair to say that the experience changed my life in two ways anyway the first was that i at last accepted i have no idea what to do with my body while watching live music has anyone sussed this the only options it seems are to sing along not an option mating foxes have better singing voices than me be one of those people who demands a 10yard radius so they can express themselves through the medium of interpretive dance again not an option for a woman whose dance moves were once mistaken for physical pain do what harry in when harry met sally describes as the white mans overbite which is biting your lower lip while moving vaguely from side to side that is the most popular option albeit not the most satisfying and i believe this is why so many white people have to get drunk after watching live music so as to achieve a delayed sense of release that was my explanation for returning home at 2am completely drunk  drunk mainly on the female artistry id just seen of course but also vodka the second way it changed my life was that i saw a 21stcentury woman using her life in her work in a way that did not make me want to punch myself in the head beyonc has long been seen as a curiously discreet celebrity which given that she makes videos about how much sex she and her equally famous husband have courtesy of his surfboard says a lot about how much female artists are expected to reveal of themselves so that fans feel a connection for her most recent album lemonade beyonc has made an entire pop opera about what sounds very much like her husbands infidelity all of this was of course on display at wembley as enraged songs about betrayal were interspersed with videos of beynjay i resent the modern message that tells women to use their personal lives in their work so i should have hated it i did not we are living in the era of the confessional specifically the female confessional from the frequently selfexploitative blogs on us website xojanecom im not attracted to my husband im glad my friend died to the nonfiction section of your local bookshop which has a new female memoir nigh on every week i suspect that a large part of the interest surrounding the norwegian writer karl ove knausgaard has to do with his gender an anomaly in what is now seen as a femalecentric field of writing about ones neuroses and family life some of my favourite books could be classed as fictionalised female memoirs  sylvia plaths the bell jar nora ephrons heartburn joan didions the year of magical thinking  but with their rigorous selfcontrol they are a long way from the selfexposure we have now a form of writing that is defined by hysterical narcissism with diminishing returns a form of selfprostitution all of my female writer friends have been encouraged to bring some of yourself into the piece ideally their children or lack of their body image or their love life almost none of my male writer friends have experienced this and i get it personal stories attract more readers and crucially internet hits than dry argument people enjoy few things more than vilifying a womans private life once someone opens a window into hers the cathartic bloodletting can commence related british protest voters made their voices heard are americans about to do the same  hadley freeman defenders see it as a feminist act rather than an anxious selfsacrifice there is nothing gutsier to me than a person announcing that their story is one that deserves to be told especially if that person is a woman lena dunham writes in her memoir not that kind of girl and sure you can look at the female memoir that way alternatively you can say that this emphasis on the confessional is telling women that their stories are the only thing they have the authority to write about thus it becomes part of the current mood of antiintellectualism in which educated analysis is dismissed as elitist and inferior to personal conviction knowledge is nothing feeling is all and yet beyonc like plath ephron and didion beyoncs credentials were well established before she turned to the personal and so she looks like a woman who is controlling her story and at the top of her game as opposed to giving it away right at the beginning after all if you start by showing us everything where do you go from there contrary to the message of one of beyoncs earliest songs which she sang last weekend women have more to offer than just me myself and i more
