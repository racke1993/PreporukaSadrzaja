family im baby jesus and shes my fluffy like many couples oliver black and his wife have pet names for each other as he points out these little terms of endearment arrive in odd ways and tend to stick around despite their often bizarre or cringeworthy nature oliver black and his wife jenny aka the baby jesus and fluffy photograph graeme robertson for the guardian oliver black saturday 9 july 2016 0629bst share on facebook share on twitter share via email share on linkedin share on google share on whatsapp share on messenger the pet names that husbands and wives give each other are usually sickening i have been startled to hear a peevish codger address his battleaxe of a wife as numsy when replying she called him pumpkin it is therefore with embarrassment that i admit to calling my wife fluffy i cant remember how it started but the habit is now so deeply entrenched that we dont think about it if i address her by her real name it sounds stilted and she thinks i am telling her off even referring to her by it when talking to a third person makes me uncomfortable but then so does calling her fluffy its a loselose situation things are easier with our close friends for they too know her by her nickname in return fluffy calls me baby jesus i do remember how this started it was at the passionate stage of our courtship and we were in the fourposter bed which we had christened pat after the postman in my barbican flat an oak fourposter let alone one with a large carved pineapple in its headboard and with strawberryshaped finials has no business in a brutalist concrete block where the ceiling clears the finials by one inch my mother had bought it as a present when i got engaged to a predecessor of fluffys a woman whose pet name at the time escapes me but who has become known since we split up acrimoniously as the peril we had the bed at the perils house and when i moved out and into the barby i took it with me leaving the p to sleep on the floor  for she had disposed of her previous bed to make room for pat i hope she got backache pat was a flimsy repro and when you moved or turned over the frame would rock and creak rhythmically as if copulation were in progress i was celibate for my first couple of years in the flat but the noise was good for my cred with the neighbours it was that moment when seed and passion spent you used to light a cigarette but as neither fluffy nor i smoked she wrapped the duvet round my head and shoulders like a shawl baby jesus she cried you look like baby jesus in the manger she told me to put on my spectacles which were small round and hornrimmed now you look even more like baby jesus then she made me get up and look at myself in the mirror the resemblance eluded me baby jesus didnt wear hornrimmed specs and the duvet made me look more like the virgin mary if anyone these awkward facts notwithstanding the name stuck although fluffy now often shortens it to bj  one of those pairs of initials that often do duty for names jb is another but some pairs are not so catchy you seldom come across a person known as say mn at the supermarket fluffy called baby jesus come and look at these beans a small boy stopped wonderstruck linguists may be able to explain this as they can such odd phenomena as the use of front stressed disyllabic words to express disbelief rubbish bollocks nonsense or archaically gammon for example its obvious of course why you dont find people called ms vd or bo the thing has grown into a cult fluffy bought a ladybird book called baby jesus and put it on display in the lav for visitors to leaf through while at stool and last christmas she snapped up at the spitalfields bricbrac market a model nativity scene with ox and ass two shepherds three wise men mary and joseph and bj with a nimbus  all in plastic she set them out on our coffee table but failed to put them away on twelfth night nine months later they are still there covered in dust which our polish cleaner ignores a devout catholic she may think it sacrilegious to touch them in the intervening period the arrangement has been disturbed so that baby jesus is no longer the centre of the other figures attention one of the shepherds has fallen on his front and the black wise man is examining the oxs bottom as in fluffys case some of our friends know me by my nickname  one of them a historian of ecclesiastical art calling me the baby jesus  and i am so used to it that i apply it to myself its baby jesus i called into the entryphone in the street outside a friends flat passersby looked twice our household is too shambolic for us to manage a weekly shopping expedition but when the fridge is empty we make an emergency sortie to the supermarket to relieve immediate needs recently when we were there fluffy wandered down an aisle and called to me from the far end baby jesus come and look at these beans  theyre on special i wish she wouldnt use that phrase a small boy aged about four who was walking past with his mother stopped and pointed up at me wonderstruck its baby jesus he gasped i smiled down at him his mother looked uncomfortable its not really baby jesus she said fluffy returning from her inspection of the beans irresponsibly interjected oh yes this is the real baby jesus all right the mother grabbed the childs hand and pulled him away shaking her head saying i dont want to get involved but the damage was done and as we continued shopping we could hear him prattling away the words baby jesus ringing out over the shelves every few seconds our routes crossed again by a spillage that had been marked off like roadworks with rubber cones the boy by now in a lather pointed at me again seized one of the cones put it to his mouth like a megaphone and shouted baby jesus down it other shoppers turned and stared i beamed at them let us hope that his scripture teacher sorted him out shrunk and other stories by oliver black is published by prospero press 999 to order a
