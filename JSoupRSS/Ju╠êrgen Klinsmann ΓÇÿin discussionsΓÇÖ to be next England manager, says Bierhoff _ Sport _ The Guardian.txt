of usa jrgen klinsmann who took germany to the semifinal of the 2006 world cup has been in charge of the usa national team since 2011 photograph ross d franklinap dominic fifield in marseille

bierhoff has suggested his compatriot jrgen klinsmann is in discussions with the football association over the vacant england head coach role and would be a good choice klinsmann who last month steered the united states to a bestever fourthplace finish at the copa amrica would fulfil the criteria stipulated by the fa he is a world cup and european championship winner who has experienced the premier league as a player with tottenham hotspur speaks excellent english and has enjoyed a fruitful career in international management with usa and germany related roberto mancini could be tempted to become englands new manager perhaps most significantly he played his part in reforming the germany national team setup a little over a decade ago bringing in bierhoff as general manager in 2004 and helping to kickstart a revolution based on discarding the old guard and the promotion of youth germany have since featured in the semifinals at six consecutive major tournaments winning the 2014 world cup its not like putting a hand on the shoulder and everything happens said bierhoff a close friend of klinsmann when asked about the fas intention to appoint a strong figure to revive englands fortunes after another miserable tournament a lot of things need to come together when we failed at euro 2000 we invested a lot in the infrastructure and the education of young players and coaches so now we have a lot of talented players and the bundesliga is investing in young players perhaps it is an advantage that good players go to england and other countries so our clubs have to bring other players through but since the arrival of jrgen klinsmann  who i think is in discussions with england  we have also given the national team a certain pride atmosphere and organisation the success of the story is the high quality but also the good organisation and good atmosphere we have in the group asked whether klinsmann could thrive with england bierhoff said he would be a good fit we started in 2004 together and hes not always how can i say nice to handle because he wants to change things but he brings motivation he has the courage to make difficult decisions and perhaps you need something like this klinsmann who steered germany to the semifinals of the 2006 world cup has overseen the usa since 2011 after a brief spell with bayern munich and is contracted until the 2018 world cup in russia the 51yearolds time in charge has had its difficulties and relations with the president of the us soccer federation sunil gulati have been strained of late not least over the governing bodys apparent reluctance to appoint a bierhofflike figure as general manager klinsmann suggested on friday in an interview with cnn that although he remains excited at building a legacy in the us the football structure in the country remains fragile and disconnected and referenced england as an example of a system built to flourish its a bigger puzzle in the united states than in other countries and its not perfect yet he said we dont have a system in place like france or germany or even south american countries if you look at the fa in england its more than 100 years old and they already have their infrastructure scouting coaches education national training centre and the pyramid is connected theres relatively little infrastructure work to do in england here in the united states building that infrastructure is still important the fa which has preferred not to comment on the identity of specific candidates has not set a timescale for the search for a manager and is likely to appoint an interim to oversee fixtures in september which include the first world cup qualifier in slovakia more news topics jurgen klinsmann england the fa share on facebook share on twitter share
