help women but run by men deborah orr as conservatives smash glass ceilings the left preaches values that it still fails to embody when jess phillips bemoaned labours lack of female leaders on twitter

share via email share on linkedin share on google share on whatsapp share on messenger ever since the financial crash britain has been told to keep calm and carry on no one has taken this advice more literally than our politicians who are so becalmed that they resemble at times the cast of an actual carry on film nigel farage excepted of course who could ever have imagined a character like him in carry on related dont confuse the conservatives embrace of female leaders with feminism  eve livingston you have to laugh as boris johnson proclaims the tories as the most progressive political party in britain and michael gove professes his delight at the allfemale fight for the tory leadership both men quite clearly considered themselves to be superior candidates to any woman until their own fight for the top job scuppered the chances of each nevertheless the fact remains one of two women will be the uks next prime minister our second female leader like our first will be a conservative and as the underdog contender andrea leadsom so gleefully put it the tories smash those glass ceilings without resort to positive discrimination this is certainly humiliating for labour the party that introduced almost all legislation that has improved womens rights that has championed equal pay since the 1970s and closed the gender pay gap by a third in its last spell in power that boasts the highest number of women mps that presided over an unprecedented increase in support for working women with young children this party just doesnt embody the values that it preaches why does labour despite decades of genderequality handwringing and 13 years of prowomen legislation just carry on elevating men labour is still ostensibly the party of britains trade unions which historically have tended to prefer to have a man at the top not that this is much discussed labour prefers burying problems to solving them so no one points out that in the era the party now dreams of recapturing the unions were sexist and that those old habits die hard no one running the party is asking whether the unions are quite the dynamic powerbase they once were let alone whether the glory days had some still lingering flaws the societal influence of the unions  and of men generally  declined alongside deindustrialisation in labour its hung on when is labour going to realise what a shell of a political party it has become youd think as it sits paralysed in crisis unable to provide a functional opposition let alone one headed by a woman the light would be dawning but instead it is so desperate to cleanse itself of its previous period in office that it sabotages its future chances of government as women in other parties step up to take charge during this period of political turbulence labour forms a cult around a gentle chap rather than seeing labours current impasse as a symptom of general failure the party prefers to fight internally about who is to blame for the ongoing disaster guess what labour no one outside the party really cares the uk is stuck with a twoparty system  electoral reform being just one of blairisms many derelictions  and so the uk needs two functioning parties sort one out the person were all waiting for appears to be angela eagle why because shes a woman is the only answer were getting not good enough related jeremy corbyn we cant leave the negotiations with europe to the tories and if eagle is the standardbearer for labour women then i despair the socalled coup she allegedly heads is just embarrassing eagle promises a leadership challenge when the time is right what is she waiting for armageddon the corbynite response has been embarrassing too when jess phillips bemoaned labours lack of female leaders on twitter this week a corbynite horde attacked her for touting eagle as an alternative so petty phillips was clearly bemoaning a failure that has lasted decades not weeks a lot of people want desperately to pretend that the recent past didnt happen and that theyve got their party back but blairism is part of labours history it cant be apologised or shouted or rallied away any more than the mistakes and derelictions of the union movement can blair came into power with a recordbreaking number of female mps in the years since many women have come and gone their critiques of parliaments elitist boys club swept under the carpet yet labour still doesnt see how insurmountable its problems are its scottish bulwark is gone routed by the snp its northern heartlands are threatened by ukip why because labour no longer offers people  men or women  a sense that they belong or matter that feeling of displacement in england more than scotland with its snpestablished civic nationalism has coalesced around immigration which is the embodiment of that displacement rather than its cause and no wonder across this swath of britain it has been perceived that labour local authorities have allowed asian gangs to abuse schoolgirls just as the parliamentary party voted to bomb muslims abroad and yet seemed to lovebomb sharia courts thats how deep labours gender equality ran no wonder the tories are laughing it is indeed a farce more comment topics women in politics labour women feminism share on facebook share on twitter share via email share on linkedin share on google share on whatsapp share on messenger
