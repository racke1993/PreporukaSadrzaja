their fairmindedness back in 2009 they swallowed their disappointment at seeing lewis hamilton and jenson button beaten on home ground by the 21yearold sebastian vettel and gave the german a standing ovation when i looked left and right in the last two laps the people were already standing up and cheering and clapping vettel said after becoming the youngest driver ever to win the british grand prix every single person in the grandstands i have to thank this is what i was dreaming of when i saw the grands prix here in the era of mansell and so on i regret a little bit that i am not an englishman as the fans are fantastic related lewis hamilton and nico rosberg given final warning by mercedes that day vettel was still a season and a half away from becoming the second german to win the world championship the man who is desperate to be the third knows that depending on events he could receive a very different reception at silverstone on sundaytomorrow nico rosbergs fans booed lewis hamilton in austria last sunday a poorly judged response to a lastlap incident that handed the englishman a win and pushed the german down to fourth place cutting his lead in the title standings after colliding with each other in the heat of battle at spa in 2014 and twice already this season and coming perilously close on several other occasions the two mercedes drivers have been given a stern warning by their team management but they have been warned before to little effect if rosberg wants to know about the sound of booing at the british grand prix he only has to ask his teams nonexecutive chairman forty years ago this month during an afternoon of high drama niki lauda was a witness to an outbreak of audible dissent from grandstands almost wholly occupied by devotees of his rival james hunt mass jeering slow handclapping and the hurling of beer cans brought formula one the closest it has ever come to a football riot lauda then the reigning world champion was engaged in a fierce battle for the title with hunt the louche golden boy of british motor racing the season was eight races old and the austrian with four wins to the englishmans two held a commanding lead as the grand prix circus arrived to begin the second half of the campaign at brands hatch where the british round was held that season bad feeling between their respective sets of supporters had been inflamed six weeks earlier when ferrari laudas team protested against hunts win in spain on the grounds that his mclaren was 18mm wider than the regulations allowed so it was but after an initial disqualification the governing body restored his win that somewhat mystifying decision kept the championship alive when the flag fell at brands hatch that day lauda made a decent start from pole position as hunts car alongside him on the grid lagged slightly but clay regazzoni in the second ferrari made a rocketlike getaway which allowed him to overtake the mclaren and cut across its bows in order to attack lauda on the inside as the cars turned into the first corner the fast tricky offcamber paddock bend seldom noted for his prudence regazzoni bounced off his teammate and spun him round into hunts path the mclaren hit the ferrari and reared into the air before crashing back to earth on its wheels as lauda continued around the first lap and the rest of the field threaded its way between the stricken cars the race was halted and the chaos began the stewards ruled that only those cars which had completed the first lap would be able to take the restart and that the drivers could not switch to their spare cars the race was due to start again in 20 minutes  insufficient time for the mclaren mechanics to replace hunts damaged front suspension it was decided too that because he had driven his crippled car back to the pits through a side gate he had not completed the first lap and would anyway be ineligible to restart when the fans heard the news the booing began the minutes went by and as beer cans started landing on the track it looked as though worse might follow after 40 minutes during which hunts car had been repaired the decision to allow the victims of the incident to compete was announced and the crowd celebrated they had more to cheer when having tailed lauda for 45 of the 76 laps the englishman overtook his rival and eased away to the chequered flag related rushs soap washes away subtleties of james hunt and niki lauda  richard williams amid scenes of general euphoria in the pit lane hunt had been out of the cockpit only a few seconds when a tv reporter asked what the win meant to him nine points 20000 dollars and a lot of happiness he said can i grab that cigarette off you ferrari however immediately lodged a protest against the decision to allow hunt to start several months later after lauda had returned to action following his nearfatal crash at the nrburgring the governing body announced the decision to remove those nine points once again putting the title race back into a balance that was settled in hunts favour only on the final day of the season nobody will be smoking a cigarette on the podium at silverstone on sunday when hamilton will be hoping to record his fourth win in his home race and his third in a row he goes into the weekend having established a moral advantage once the stewards in austria correctly determined that rosberg was to blame for their most recent altercation at a time when the sports reputation is at an alltime low such personalised rivalry can only be good news at the box office silverstone will be packed this weekend as usual to witness the progress of this increasingly bitter internecine battle but the television audience will also be boosted by those wanting to see what happens when the two drivers next find themselves disputing the lead as they point their silver arrows into a highspeed corner and how the british spectators who played a part in the equally intense battle between hunt and lauda 40 years ago respond to the attempt by the fans in austria to humiliate a man who with three wins in the last four races now has momentum firmly on his side more comment topics british grand
