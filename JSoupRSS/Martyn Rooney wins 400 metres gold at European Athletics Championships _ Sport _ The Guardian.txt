rooney had to display grit in spades just to reach these european championships  so when he felt the hot breath of the chasing pack he was always going to dig even deeper and be stubbornness personified his sweet reward was 400m gold the first athlete to retain this title since roger black 26 years ago as well as the satisfaction of proving british athletics selectors  who had wanted him to miss this event to focus on the 4x400m relay  utterly and completely wrong rooneys gold took britain top of the medal table after day three of these championships but there were impressive reinforcements elsewhere with jazmin sawyers smashing her personal best to finish with long jump silver and danny talbot and anyika onuora taking bronze medals in the mens 200m and womens 400m respectively related dina ashersmith becomes first british woman to win 200m european title but it was rooney who led the way judging his race perfectly to rein in belgiums kevin borlee who had set off like a hare before holding off the fastfinishing czech pavel maslak to win in 4529sec with the dutch athlete liemarvin bonevacia snatching third ahead of borlee that last 50 metres felt a bloody long way said rooney who won by only 007sec ive backed it up and credit to british athletics for listening to me other athletes have come here and theyve picked up medals and there will be more to come sawyers who tried gymnastics and the bobsleigh before settling on the long jump produced the leap of her life to take silver a mere six centimetres behind the favourite ivana spanovic from croatia who jumped 694m im really proud with that performance said sawyers the wind was mental one minute plus four metres a second the next minus two but i coped with it and i couldnt be happier the biggest cheer of the night came for the home favourite dafne schippers who stormed to victory in the womens 100m in 1090 sec but there was heartache both for britains asha philip who finished fourth in 1127sec and desiree henry who had to be carried off the track after pulling up sharply philip who rushed to comfort her teammate said she expected henry would be fine she was in shock i think she might have spiked her hand because there was blood on her hand she explained i just calmed her down and made sure she was still ok and im sure shell be fine but talbot was the beneficiary of dutch misfortune when he was upgraded to bronze after finishing fourth in the mens 200m when the original winner churandy martin was disqualified for stepping out of his lane that meant gold went to the spaniard bruno hortelando in 2045 011sec ahead of talbot britains highly vaunted nethaneel mitchellblake who broke 20 seconds earlier this year before getting injured did not look completely fit as he finished fifth related jo paveys late surge puts her in pole position for olympics slot there was further good news for britain in the womens 400m as onuora ran 5147 to take bronze  holding off the former olympic and world champion christine ohurougu who finished 008sec behind in a race won by the italian libania grenot onuora said i kept fighting and driving and diving through the line and it paid off but i didnt know until afterwards because they kept us waiting on the scoreboard for a long while i thought it must have been close and i was hoping and praying id get the third spot  and i did however in the womens hammer sophie hitchon was unfortunate to miss out on the podium finishing fourth behind the polish gold medallist annita wlodarcyzk after throwing 7174m and there was disappointment for the 400m hurdles hope jack green too who flattened his first hurdle then seven of the next nine before pulling up before the end and rhys williams who admitted his career was probably over after coming home fifth in 4963sec meanwhile earlier in the day morgan lake withdrew from the womens heptathlon after the third event the shot put citing a tight hamstring the 20yearold had been hoping to reach the 6200 points qualifying mark but had fallen to 10th position when she pulled out she will still be eligible for olympic selection inthe womens high jump when the selectors
