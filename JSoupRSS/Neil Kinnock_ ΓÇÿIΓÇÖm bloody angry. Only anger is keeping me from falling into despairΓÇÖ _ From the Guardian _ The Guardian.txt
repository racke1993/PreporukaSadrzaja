london kitchen when i arrive and who should be gazing out of the screen but jeremy corbyn kinnock bustles about making coffee keeping one eye on the labour leader while he laments the state of the garden and laughs about his wife glenyss terror of mice he was woken at 645am by shrieks and spent the first part of his day chasing a mouse with a tea towel he will spend the evening with his two children and their spouses watching wales play portugal in the semifinal of the euros on tv and sparkles with the same irrepressible bonhomie familiar from all our previous encounters on this occasion however appearances are misleading im bloody angry only anger is keeping me from falling into despair its bloody appalling the whole bloody thing is appalling the referendum was won by falsehood and prejudice kinnock suffered two general election defeats as labour leader but 23 june was the worst of his lifetime simply because everything else thats ever happened thats bad has been redeemable or reversible this is of a different dimension he is angry with david cameron for promptly resigning because it was the captains job to stay on the bridge just in terms of duty  straightforward duty but above all he is angry with corbyn people divide into those who are vain and those who are not he observes glancing over at the telly and jeremy is a vain man facebook twitter pinterest david cameron paddy ashdown and neil kinnock making campaign calls for britain stronger in europe before last months eu referendum photograph stefan rousseauafpgetty images kinnock was never a fan and has made several critical public comments in the last nine months but ive been mostly quiet despite many invitations not to be now he is publicly calling for the leader to resign  and on monday delivered a barnstorming speech to the parliamentary labour party so loud that reporters in neighbouring corridors could hear his roar has he ever before called for a labour leader to stand down at a plp meeting he looks at me as if i must be mad good god no the last time i heard it it was leo abse making a lone voice call in the wake of the 1970 election for harold wilson to go this is he says a political crisis unlike anything he has ever seen before related secret recording of kinnocks anticorbyn speech to mps  in full ill tell you what happened he says about the meeting from which the press was excluded the atmosphere was quite tense there was real dissatisfaction that jeremy wasnt there you know if i had to fly back from india to get to a plp meeting i would and i think thats true of most party leaders but anyway jeremy wasnt there people made very candid statements not vicious it was just very direct even people who had not voted for the noconfidence motion last week got up and said im now part of the 172 who voted for it one of the women mps said its now 173 then one of the men called across no its 174 kinnock hadnt planned to say anything i had absolutely no intention of speaking my view was this is for the mps but then dennis skinner spoke and in my view gave an interpretation of history through which i lived that was seriously erratic he said this plp mustnt think that its more important than the rest of the party well the fact of the matter is hes been sitting in meetings since 1970 and he knows damn well that theres never been the merest suggestion that a view should be taken because the plp is more important its taken because the plp has a duty it cant escape its not about relative importance and he knew that damn well and i thought wait a minute dennis you cant get away with that it was at that point i put my hand up to speak he remembers that he told his audience there has been a lot of talk about history well let me say a little bit about history weve been on the edge of the abyss before but weve never been deep into it like this he said he would not allow the party he has belonged to for 60 years to split we are a democratic socialist parliamentary party not content to be a bannerwagging social protest movement by the end the former shadow minister lucy powell was in tears and the audience on its feet in a standing ovation corbyn of course has not resigned a leadership challenge will unquestionably therefore be mounted according to kinnock  and as the last labour leader to have faced such a challenge he has a lot to say about the rules that it was corbyn and some of his current team who led tony benns 1988 leadership challenge against kinnock is an irony upon which he does not dwell perhaps for fear of looking motivated by bad blood the point he says is that corbyn and his team are now trying to break the partys own rules related all change a brief history of british political leadership contests the rule book clearly states he insists that in order to be a candidate corbyn would be obliged to secure the support of 20 of the plp corbyns team insist that as the incumbent his name would automatically go on to the ballot paper if that were true argues kinnock why did he himself have to secure nominations when challenged by benn and why did corbyns own supporters call for a change to the rule in march when they acknowledged that the current labour party rules do not clearly spell out that an incumbent leader is automatically on the ballot paper for leader in the event of a challenger securing the requisite nominations unsurprisingly lawyers have been consulted on both sides should corbyns name get on to the ballot kinnock has an urgent message to everyone who wants to see a viable opposition in parliament it comes when i ask if he wants people to join labour in order to vote in the leadership election yes definitely  and now labour supporters across britain recognise that the 17240 vote of no confidence in jeremy corbyn came from mps who are constantly in touch with voters and dedicated to trying to make labour electable they have made it clear that he cannot give the leadership that is vital to gain credibility and national appeal for our party all labour people should therefore immediately join in order to be able to vote i urge everyone who wants to strengthen labour to do that it is crucial if we are to gain leadership with the values the quality and the broad appeal thats needed to challenge and overcome the tories corbyns supporters accuse his critics of exploiting the referendum defeat so i ask if this was a coup waiting for an excuse he hoots well if it was they kept it secret from me and i mix and mingle what precipitated the revolt was not the referendum per se he says  although the fact that jeremy did 10 events in six weeks is pretty conclusive evidence that either he or people influencing him really didnt want to put too much effort in facebook twitter pinterest neil kinnock and roy hattersley on the day kinnock became leader of the labour party in 1983 photograph paempics the catalyst he says was the sudden prospect of an imminent election and despite theresa mays assurance that she would not call one i think the chemistry of politics in the wake of her election with a majority of a dozen will say there are some arguments weve got to settle theresa you cannot repeat the gordon brown experience we must go now as his own mps do not believe he could possibly win the idea that a party committed to the parliamentary route to socialism could be led by someone who doesnt have at least substantial support in the parliamentary party is not taking itself or its mission seriously i was a teenager when i first heard kinnock making the case that labour could only help the worstoff by winning power and could only win power by appealing to the broader electorate did he expect to still have to make it now good god no he is not however surprised that it needs to be made once again under corbyn related jeremy corbyn we cant leave the negotiations with europe to the tories deep conviction is entirely creditable but dogmatic adherence to policy issues is not realistic you cant even bring up kids on that basis i dont think you can even buy a car on that basis people of deep convictions can afford to compromise people of shallow convictions are terrified of compromise because they will consider that to compromise is to betray well if youve got deep convictions you know damn well it isnt you know that compromise is a means of getting to the next stage a bit closer to what you originally wanted to do its called parliamentary democracy corbyns supporters invoke democracy too in defence of a leader democratically elected by the party only nine months ago kinnock is at pains to make no criticism of the hundreds of thousands of youngsters who joined the party to get corbyn elected last year and says i certainly welcome the vitality energy hope optimism because i dont think democratic socialism can run on an empty tank parallels have been drawn between momentum and militant tendency which kinnock took on and defeated in the 80s but he disagrees facebook twitter pinterest kinnock with among others paul weller and ken livingstone in 1985 at a red wedge event intended to get young people interested in politics photograph richard youngrex no those people were a threat to our democratic socialist character and priorities now were in a different situation these highly intelligent very wellintentioned principled people who joined en masse are smart young people but a small number of people who are either longlasting sectarians or new to the sectarian game saw the opportunity and have not ceased since to try to manipulate them and with some success he doesnt mean he says quickly that momentums members are fools i feel the absolute opposite to any idea that the people who joined last year are simpleminded the absolute opposite but when people have had a lot of practice in helping to mould the opinions of people with great intentions  well theyre pretty good at it theyve been doing it for decades and when people who have had long practice in organisation and influence can produce phrases that appear to chime with your thinking your hope and ambition for change in our society then people will accept propositions that if they sat down and thought about it they often wouldnt he doesnt believe dissident labour mps will break away and split the party i understand the argument for it but theyd be wishing themselves into a different universe unless and until we have a government that will secure the enactment of proportional representation people who talk about realignments are in reality talking about fragmentation nor does he foresee some broad progressive parliamentary alliance not because im tribalist but because such a coalition in order to be effective would have to be very broad  and if its very broad its by definition also very brittle related jeremy corbyn stands defiant after labour membership surge what then does kinnock forsee if in the immediate future the feeling that parliament was no good for the advance of progressive ideas really took hold it would be a crisis of a different dimension no doubt about that in the end i dont think it will but the very small sectarian element in all this has inevitably moved from extraparliamentary effort to trying to mobilise antiparliamentary effort thats what happens i wonder whether the parallel to be drawn is not with the internal battles of the 80s but with the international crisis of the 1930s if people recognise the causes and horrific consequences of that i think we wont descend into that abyss im not being complacent i just dont think the lessons of the 1930s have been forgotten but if anybody is not familiar with them i think they ought to read george orwell people who forget their past are doomed to relive it thats why weve got to make sure we dont forget that past it is beginning i suggest to look horribly reminiscent yeah but were not there and we can ensure we never are there but an old mans optimism is by definition shortterm and im an old man more interviews topics eu referendum jeremy corbyn labour share on facebook share on twitter share via email share on linkedin share on
