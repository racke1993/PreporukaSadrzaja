tricolours and the mood celebratory as didier deschamps ushered his victors through the massed ranks of media and out into the night those who had stopped to offer their thoughts had spoken of the excellence of antoine griezmann of making history against the world champions and the need to focus on the challenge ahead portugal will be no pushovers yet the same theme kept cropping up a squad united a team spirit that will not be shaken a collective that in laurent koscielnys words remains unis solide related france fly past germany to the final  euro 2016 football daily in some ways it all felt distinctly unfrench for all that the chance to host these finals has conjured giddy memories of michel platini inspiring success back in 1984 or zinedine zidane and the spirit of black blanc beur blacks whites and arabs as the world cup was claimed 14 years later the national team have too often been associated with anarchy and infighting in recent times it had blighted them in south korea and switzerland and had even threatened to derail them here over karim benzema mathieu valbuena and accusations of blackmail over a sextape a scandal almost too outlandish to comprehend most troublingly of course was the open revolt in south africa in 2010 stemming from raymond domenechs exclusion of nicolas anelka which prompted patrice evra to lead his teammates on a oneday strike against the management the defender would be stripped of the captaincy and banned at a disciplinary hearing after that tournament with many from lilian thuram to government ministers suggesting he should never play for his country again yet while france spasms at the hands of industrial action on almost a weekly basis no one has come to personify the newfound sense of unity within deschamps squad better than evra he is the senior professional who delivers the tubthumping rallying cry in the huddle as the fitness coaches oversee the prematch stretches and conducts teammates and supporters through the postmatch celebrations he has fronted up to the media after those sluggish early displays in the group and warned all of the need to wake up or risk being cast from the festival his manager has encouraged him to accept such responsibility the 35yearold has even taken paul pogba the youngster to whom the country had pinned such weighty expectations under his wing in an attempt to deflect the focus france has delighted in the footage of the juventus pair dancing back at the teams clairefontaine base or even interviewing each other  in italian  for the cameras after the victory over germany the fullback once dubbed the dinosaur by a new generation of defenders queueing up to claim his place has become a father figure he has never been more integral we have made this group into a family he said the breakthrough moment probably came for us in that playoff win over ukraine in november 2013 when they overcame a 20 firstleg deficit to triumph 32 and qualify for the world cup because after that we had a good tournament in brazil that gave us a platform a chance to progress now though we must become a nation of winners once again and the only way to do that is to end this tournament with the trophy i have never won anything with the france team and it would feel like a failure for me a blot on my career if it stayed like that but we have a chance now i am proud of all my teammates theyre doing their utmost to try to make me cry by winning the european championship related paul pogba teaches brilliant but blunt germans a lesson in cutting edge  barney ronay this may be his last chance to break that duck though the french once so keen to rid themselves of a man perceived to be divisive and political will be diminished without him the rearguard action in marseille when germany were in the ascendancy and dimitri payet was offering evra next to no protection down the left flank had tested that backline but the hosts had stood firm hugo lloris was outstanding bacary sagna has been quietly impressive all tournament koscielny too and a gem has been unearthed in samuel umtiti retreat a little over a week and the centrehalf had been an uncapped lyon player included in deschamps squad only because of raphal varanes injury and mamadou sakhos suspension now umtiti is a 246m barcelona defender  the paperwork will officially be signed off after the tournament  who has helped shut out the world cup holders and who will earn his third cap confronting cristiano ronaldo in the final of euro 2016 im still pinching myself over everything thats happened in the last few days but i wont let it go to my head he said i try not to get carried away i live from day to day because honestly i never thought id be involved in something like this it has been an amazing month a sacred july but we knew we wouldnt have the ball on thursday and we were prepared for that he said we had to be tight defensively and give everything we had but when you see your wingers and midfielders putting in the effort they were you want to go into battle with them that summed up the spirit this squad has never been tighter their bond strengthened with a nation in need of a dose of positivity after the terrorist atrocities of last november and months of social unrest whipped up by reforms to labour laws les bleus have won their past 10 games against portugal extend that record to 11 and france revived by their football team will rejoice as one more features topics france euro 2016 share on facebook share on twitter share via email share on linkedin share
