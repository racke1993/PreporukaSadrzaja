contrast to jos mourinho at united manchester city have spent so long trying to nail pep guardiola as manager that amazing success is expected and soon photograph oli scarffafpgetty images daniel

on messenger the bottles of water lined up on pep guardiolas table were branded city football there were so many people wanting entry they were giving out wristbands festivalstyle and when he took his seat there was a moment when he turned to his left looked out of the window at the villagesized training ground and blew out his cheeks in admiration a lot of people do that when they are new to this part of manchester it just resonates more when it is a member of football royalty previously of barcelona and bayern munich these were the moments when we were reminded how far this rejuvenated old club has come under the ownership of the abu dhabi royal family alan ball used to turn up to some press conferences clutching a glass of beer frank clark found out on his first day at city there was not enough training kit for the players and kevin keegans introductory press conference took place in a bar at maine road where what was left of the carpet stuck to ones shoes keegan still raw from his experiences with england had not received the memo that these events are supposed to be bright and convivial the vultures are here then he had said before taking his seat six fulltime managers on guardiola has joined a very different club his wife cristina was in the third row surrounded by a clutch of family friends and when guardiola described himself as always nervous  afraid of you all referring to his first audience with a group of unfamiliar journalists we were reminded of the difference between himself and the man who had taken part in a similar event across the city a few days earlier jos mourinho had swept into manchester united as if he already felt like a part of old traffords fittings  not perhaps the most bullish we have seen him but bullish all the same and delivering a classic piece of braggadocio in his explanation why he apparently had no reason to goad guardiola arsne wenger or anyone else i am the manager of manchester united mourinho said i am the manager of the biggest club in the uk so i dont have to look at the others so much guardiola in comparison was less demonstrative measured in his statements and nonconfrontational in a way that seemed genuine there was barely a trace of ego from the most coveted coach in the industry there were no bold promises about what he could do or showy statements about what he had done in the past in fact the man credited with assembling the most beautifully efficient barcelona side of all time was modest to the point it was tempting to interrupt and remind him of some of those previous glories he was lucky he said more than once presumably referring to the fact he had so many exquisitely talented players at camp nou and he seemed awkward about the suggestion that he had been hired as some sort of football messiah to come to the country who created football and believe you have to change something would be a little bit presumptuous im not good enough to change everything no  shaking head to change the mentality of a club that has been around for 120 years would be presumptuous i trust a lot in myself i think i am able to do the job but i dont come here to think i can change the mentality or the culture of england maybe not england but guardiola has been appointed to change city and if anything that is the danger for the man to quote jorge valdano who believes in football where greatness is possible  he never cheats he is always brave he takes away all the miseries of the game city have spent so long trying to nail this man down that amazing success is expected and soon guardiola has been an obsession for city the man they expect will win them the champions league and that brings considerable pressure it is demanding in barcelona like you cannot imagine guardiola pointed out in return you cannot imagine you cannot survive there if you dont win i survived four years because in the first year i won if not i would have been sacked equally he understood the point i need time i know i dont have time it was the same at barcelona the same in munich so that is the expectation people dont expect to see in january and february how good we are they expect it in the first friendly game against bayern munich on 20 july how good is pep it wont be easy he is after all new to england and it came across in the number of times he talked about having never played on boxing day or in stadiums where it is freezing or windy city start the new season at home to sunderland followed a week later by a trip to stoke and it did sound slightly strange to hear guardiola talk about preparing to meet big sam and expecting it to be more physical than the football he has encountered elsewhere i dont need two months to know here will be completely different when i see a guy who played here like xabi alonso i always say tell me about england tell me about the premier league i never found one person who said oh it will be easy for you they all said its tough its tough i dont know why thats what i want to discover the big clubs go wherever theyre soft in a game and they are able to lose i have to discover that for myself i have to see that he needs to pick it up quickly too because none of this is new to mourinho but it is also worth remembering guardiola has been preparing himself for this move for several years the reason why he moved to new york after leaving barcelona was primarily because he was so tired my energy was spent it was empty yet there were ulterior motives i went there to improve my english he said if bayern munich had not come for me maybe with the english teams manchester city i would have come here then related pep guardiola v jos mourinho unveilings who drew first blood  jamie jackson note the use of the word teams  in plural just about every major club in england has wanted him at one stage or another yet city always had a headstart once abu dhabi put in place the former barcelona executives ferran soriano and txiki begiristain to run the operation txiki was so important in my life guardiola said when i was absolutely nobody when i was nothing they trusted me to handle this amazing club barcelona and amazing players i said to him once i go to england if you are with one club i will go to you he has kept his word with such a long preamble he was even consulted about transfer business last summer when manuel pellegrini was manager on that basis it should be no surprise that guardiola sounds so supportive of raheem sterling the catalan was involved in the process that brought him to the club in the first place sterling has already had a call from his new manager and do not be surprised to see an upturn in his form next season the problem is recovering confidence when a player has no quality guardiola said then i cannot help him but sterling has quality he just has to focus on his life his profession and im pretty sure he will play good guardiola wanted good body language on the pitch and the attitude i run for you you run for me he wanted to keep their confidence every training session every speech every time we speak whether were taking a beer together or whatever as for mourinho could he see a day where their mutual dislike of one another was put aside for good and two men who will now be neighbours actually went for dinner together i think it will happen naturally guardiola said one day i will arrive in a restaurant and he will be there it will be hi how are you he will say hi as well mourinho one imagines would be far less inclined to clink glasses if guardiola is every bit as good as his new employers expect him to be more features topics pep guardiola manchester city share on facebook share on twitter share via email share on linkedin share on google share on whatsapp share on messenger
