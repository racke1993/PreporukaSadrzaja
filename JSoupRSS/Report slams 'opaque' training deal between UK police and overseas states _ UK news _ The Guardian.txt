with dubious human rights records threatens the integrity of the uk brand of policing that such programmes aim to promote internationally a parliamentary report has warned in highly critical findings about how security personnel from states such as saudi arabia benefit from british assistance the home affairs select committee describe the governments refusal to reveal details of opaque training agreements as totally unacceptable the mps also state that the lack of transparency around the contracts mean the foreign offices own guidance on ensuring human rights obligations are met may not be

committee on the college of policing which has statutory responsibility for setting standards for british forces set up in 2012 it is regarded as one of the legacy projects of the home secretary theresa may however the college has been put under pressure by the home office to raise revenues the report notes and has generated more than 85m from international work that has included providing training in forensics child abuse investigations and counterterrorism facebook twitter pinterest foreign secretary philip hammond came in for fierce criticism from committee chair keith vaz photograph sean gallupgetty images such engagements and in particular the specialist training given to hundreds of saudi officers have recently come under a critical spotlight the committee said it had been told by the colleges chief executive alex marshall that the foreign office had advised him not to answer questions on the matter for reasons of commercial confidentiality and security the foreign secretary philip hammond was also criticised for not providing details of the contracts when requested by the committee its chair keith vaz said for a foreign secretary to act in this manner and tell the british parliament that he will not disclose such important information is totally unacceptable withholding the terms of the provision of training threatens the integrity of the very brand of british

establishment of a system of accreditation for high risk areas of policing the colleges role is just one part of this and we welcome the committees call on others from the policing landscape to support the profession to deliver consistent standards he added we are committed to transparency and are keen to help the public understand our international work as much as possible the home office said the creation of the independent college of policing has been an important pillar in our programme of police reform setting professional standards sharing best practice and ensuring police training and ethics are considered and to of the highest possible quality given the high level of skill and expertise across british policing it is not surprising that there is an international appetite to learn from the best we cannot stand by and criticise countries from the sidelines if we want to see wholesale changes and the governments policing programmes in saudi arabia led by the college of policing are specifically designed to improve the justice system by improving human rights compliance and reducing the likelihood of miscarriages of justice more news topics police foreign
