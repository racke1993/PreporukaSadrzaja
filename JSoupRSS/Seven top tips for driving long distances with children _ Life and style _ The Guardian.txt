family how to  seven top tips for driving long distances with children from leaving early to ice cream bribery to a technology detox  and dont ask if they need the toilet promises of climbing castles eating food and petting zoo animals could tame even the surliest child photograph alamy john ahern saturday 9 july 2016 0630bst share on facebook share on twitter share via email share on linkedin share on google share on whatsapp share on messenger as i was planning my familys yearlong road trip i asked a group of parents in a playground for their top tips for travelling with children on long days of driving they looked at my kids aged four and two rolling on the grass like itchy puppies and shouted in unison dont my wife and i had just bought an old motorhome sight unseen online so this advice wasnt helpful and 40000km 30 countries and one year later i realised they were wrong by trial and error and with many tears often mine we discovered the best ways to have a great family road trip leave early go slow after a week of solid driving north through the norwegian fjords towards the arctic circle my family staged a revolution by way of a sitin demanding a nodrive day revelling in this break from then on we slowed down ensuring we were stationary for at least one day in every three on particularly long driving days we left early ensuring everybody was fresh and arrived before the kids witching hour we stopped regularly at parks or playgrounds where unlatched from their seatbelts the kids ran free like puppies off leashes this childfriendly pace of dawdling tea stops and long lazy lunches created as much entertainment as the awesome destinations intransit activities armed with colouring and reading books and paper and with no mobile internet the kids started entertaining themselves we sang silly songs told stories and sometimes they slept occasionally we counted cows castles or yellow cars through the windows at these times i tried not to be gamecompetitive  theres little dignity in screaming i won at a twoyearold food the great distractor being with my children 247 for an extended period i discovered how food constantly simmered in their little minds promising it making it drawing it from anticipation to devouring food was the great distractor just murmuring the word gelato could produce wellbehaved discipline an army sergeant would yearn for we also maintained a spare crisp packet in the glovebox of the vehicle at all times cracked open like a glassfronted fire alarm only in emergencies which seemed to occur quite often promises promises of climbing castles eating food and petting zoo animals could tame even the surliest child butthe great parental trap the illthoughtout promise was to be avoided when i found there was no gelato in the high atlas mountains in morocco and no ice hotel in sweden it melts in summer the disappointment blowback was extreme dont mention the toilet has everybody been to the toilet seemed like a reasonable question at the start of each drive invariably the kids said yes within five minutes of being on the road however the toilet concept sunk in forcing an emergency pullover we stopped mentioning it set holy grail destinations driving for weeks towards the north pole became a pumpedup adventure once the kids knew they would visit laplands santa claus and feed his reindeers turkey easy  underground cities oxford the grand hall of hogwarts involved in the upcoming destinations the children would chirp like excited squirrels making the journey that much better disconnect to truly connect no tv internet tablets or phones  it seemed like a good idea to reclaim oldfashioned family time and let the kids imaginations run wild and it was  for a week soon we began to crave a hit of google but immersed in the rarefied air of each others company and discovering a new level of mutual attentiveness we played games lit fires counted the bonging of church bells and connected as a family as never before after driving from the arctic circle to morocco through eastern europe turkey and back again i shared this final disconnect to connect idea with the same parents who told me not to do the trip i suggested that switching off technology and being trapped in the bubble of a car offers one of the greatest ever opportunities for family togetherness their group reply cant think of anything worse i couldnt think of anything better  john ahern is the author of on the road  with kids one familys lifechanging gap year is published by summersdale 899 more features topics family
