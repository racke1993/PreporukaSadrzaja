ends meet we ask how theyll manage rebecca clayton with her daughter molly organising the logistics of everyones annual leave each year is stressful photograph felix clay for the guardian donna ferguson saturday 9 july 2016 0701bst share on facebook share on twitter share via email share on linkedin share on google share on whatsapp share on messenger the cost of childcare in the summer holidays is now so high that some parents will have trouble paying their household bills over the coming months and will have to rely on overdrafts and credit cards to survive the sixweek break exclusive research for guardian money conducted by the financial hardship charity turn2us shows that more than a third 36 of parents are worried about the impact of the summer holidays on their ability to pay bills and expenses around 15 say they are likely to have to rely on overdrafts loans and credit cards to get them through meanwhile a separate survey of working parents carried out by nationwide suggests that almost threequarters of couples will have to split their leave in order to look after their children three in 10 have had to go away on holiday minus their partner with around one in10 regularly doing so due to work we spoke to four parents in very different circumstances around the country to see how they cope with the expense of the break  rebecca clayton 28 lives in watford with her daughter molly aged eight she works fulltime and earns 28000 and estimates the summer holidays will cost her an additional 400 relying on family rather than paidfor childcare means there is no backup if someone falls ill or messes their dates up when molly started school as a single mother i was very worried about how i was going to cope with the cost of the holidays but when i told my mother how anxious i felt my parents and my younger sister each volunteered to take a weeks annual leave every year to look after molly my ex will also have her for a week and one week there will be a 180 mix of childcare annual leave and days out with her friends then were staying with my friend in paris for a week which will cost 500 luckily im going to be saving the 5060 a week id normally spend on childcare before and after school during termtime ill give my sister 50 to cover mollys expenses such as taking her to london museums but my parents wont accept any money because they know i cant afford to give them any they tend to do free stuff like taking her to see her cousins or going swimming in a lake anyway im glad molly gets to spend time with her family but organising and coordinating all the logistics of everyones annual leave each year is stressful relying on family rather than paidfor childcare means there is no backup if someone falls ill or messes their dates up  if they let me down at the last minute ill have to take unpaid leave that worry weighs heavily on my mind all through the year facebook twitter pinterest laura davies with her son max its tiring and stressful looking after a child all day and then going to work in the evening photograph collect  laura davies 25 and partner scott castle 26 live in bournemouth with their son max 5 and have a household income of 15000 most weeks ill be looking after max during the day and working in the evening says laura i work late shifts in a bookshop while scott works parttime for tesco we deliberately organised our jobs that way so we dont have to pay for childcare after school or during the holidays  one of us is always at home to look after max but it also means we dont get any time together as a family even at the weekends one of us is always at work one day over the holidays were not planning to take max anywhere that costs money were fortunate we live in bournemouth so the beach and new forest are nearby and in the summer the council puts on lots of free events for holidaymakers were relying on those events to keep our costs down well take a packed lunch so our main expense mostly will be petrol and parking that will cost between 10 and 15 a week i wish childcare in the summer holidays wasnt so expensive its tiring and stressful looking after a child all day and then going to work in the evening theres also no job progression if youre parttime so we havent been able to go for promotions at work i very much enjoy my time with max  but it does involve a lot of juggling  vicky clifton 43 and husband mike 51 live in leeds with their daughter molly 13 and son darcy 10 they both work fulltime earning nearly 70000 a year between them they reckon they will spend an extra 4300 during the summer holidays compared to their usual expenses you expect so much of your kids during the school year and you want them to go back in september refreshed and feeling like theyve had a lovely memorable summer says vicky i feel constantly guilty for working  i want my children to grow up having had adventures in the school holidays facebook twitter pinterest climbing trees at a little forest folk holiday camp photograph philippa gedgelittle forest folk so each year i plan their summer break like a military operation first i send them both to a weeklong outdoor residential summer camp where they learn things like rock climbing and bushcraft it costs us around 1650 but they absolutely love it and i can work late that week without feeling guilty then mike and i will also each take a weeks annual leave separately to be with them its hard to find free family activities to do with older children so the costs quickly add up we will probably spend around 500 on day trips over those two weeks well also occasionally give each of them 30 to go on a day out with their friends our family holiday will be a week in a caravan in devon which is costing 2000 its been four years since weve been able to afford a holiday abroad in the school holidays and now ive totted up what we spend during the summer im not surprised i dont know how wed manage if we couldnt rely on my mother who is 70 to look after them for two weeks  although even then keeping them entertained will cost about 200 i dont know how wed manage if we couldnt rely on my mother who is 70 to look after them for two weeks each year i dread paying for it all year we have to budget carefully so we can spread the cost but because we take most of our leave separately we get very little time together as a family  amy edwards and husband james both 38 live in cornwall with their sons jake 7 and finn 6 not their real names their household income is more than 100000 and they estimate the holidays will cost around 7000 related the wanttowork mothers trapped at home by prohibitive cost of childcare one of the reasons i set up my own business was because it would allow me to be very flexible during the summer holidays says amy this summer ill work 1520 hours a week in the office  but that comes at a price im now the primary breadwinner and my time off will cost my business 6000 in lost earnings even though ill work evenings and weekends to try to mitigate that my husband who works fulltime during the week will see my laptop more than hell see me when i work from home it is impossible when the boys are there  i cant give them the attention they need they end up watching tv all day and that makes me feel awful i want them to have summers that will enrich their lives so this year for 10 days over three weeks im sending them to holiday camps a cricket club a forest school and a drama class each costs 25 per child per day but only runs from 9am to 3pm which gives me just five hours to work those days even then i feel guilty im not with them five days a week so ill end up spending 50 on outings with them on my days off feeling the pinch so why are the school holidays so expensive for parents despite passionate rhetoric from politicians very little has been done to address the problem of holiday childcare says imelda redmond of the charity 4children for example councils are still not required to offer any subsidised childcare for schoolchildren at all during the summer holidays many parents rely on formal childcare providers like holiday clubs to look after their children  but a record high number of these providers are closing their doors during the holidays redmond says those that do stay open may not accept taxfree childcare vouchers and typically do not provide care for afull working day more features topics childcare family finances household bills children school holidays share on facebook share on twitter share via email share on
