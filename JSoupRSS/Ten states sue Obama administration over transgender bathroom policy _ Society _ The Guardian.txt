bathrooms and locker rooms consistent with their gender identity the lawsuit filed in federal court in nebraska comes after 11 other states sued to block the same policy in may barack obama announced the new rules as his administration fought an intensifying battle with north carolina which passed a law barring transgender people from using bathrooms and other gendered facilities that dont match the gender listed on their birth certificates the federal policy applies to every public school district in the country and districts that fail to comply risk forfeiting millions in federal funding with fridays lawsuit the number of states challenging the policy reaches almost two dozen many observers predict that the battle will ultimately come before the supreme court bathroom access is just one flashpoint in a farreaching clash over transgender rights this year alone state lawmakers introduced dozens of bills that would permit broad discrimination against transgender individuals in hiring housing and business sometimes on the basis of religion in june the pentagon announced an end to its ban on openly transgender service members in the armed forces related us military ends ban on transgender service members but access to gendered spaces is one area where the obama administration has sought to make a big impact moving aggressively to make an example of an illinois school district that failed to fully accommodate a trans girl and suing north carolina over its broad prohibitions on transgender peoples use of public facilities those actions inspired cries of government overreach which the plaintiffs in this new lawsuit echoed on friday when a federal agency takes such unilateral action  it leaves state and local authorities with no other option than to pursue legal clarity in federal court in order to enforce the rule of law said doug peterson the attorney general of nebraska leslie rutledge the attorney general of arkansas which joined the lawsuit blasted the administrations rule on friday as a radical social policy that raises serious safety concerns for schoolage children part of a liberal social agenda and a detriment to the very children it intends to help an earlier statement by the kansas board of education said the federal rule removes the local control needed to effectively address this sensitive issue and called for giving schools flexibility a spokeswoman for the justice department declined on friday to comment on the lawsuit in may in response to the suit brought by 11 states led by texas a justice department spokesman said the government has strong legal foundations to uphold the civil rights of transgender americans advocates for transgender equality argue that restroom and locker room bans carry a severe and negative impact for transgender students being in a school that affirms and supports their gender identity is critical to ensuring that they too can experience adolescence in a healthy and constructive manner read one brief by leading medical societies in support of a virginia student who sued for the right to use the boys bathroom refusing to respect and affirm a transgender students gender identity communicates a clear negative message there is something wrong with the student that warrants this unequal treatment the 10 states joining the lawsuit are arkansas kansas michigan montana nebraska north dakota ohio south carolina south dakota and wyoming in march south dakotas republican governor dennis daugaard vetoed a measure that would have banned transgender students from using the restroom matching their gender identity at stake is not only the ability of trans students to express their gender identity but also millions of dollars in federal funding that schools violating the policy stand to lose related how did bathrooms get to be separated by gender in the first place nebraska which is leading the lawsuit expects to receive more than 312m in federal funding for its local school districts next year south carolina received 870m last year and kansas received 511m for local school districts additional money to the states went to specialized schools for the blind or deaf and to juvenile correctional facilities in its separate legal battle with the department of justice north carolina stands to lose 48bn on federal funds to its school districts colleges and universities central to the lawsuit is the meaning of the word sex in title ix of the civil rights act which outlaws discrimination on the basis of sex congress and the senate have rejected numerous bills that would amend title ix and other federal civil rights laws to ban discrimination on the basis of gender identity in 2014 the education departments office of civil rights clarified that the federal ban on sex discrimination extends to claims of discrimination based on gender identity or failure to conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity that included transgender status said eric holder the attorney general at the time the new interpretation was a sharp reversal from the definition of sex used by the george w bush administration it cleared the way for the education department to take action against individual schools that continued to block transgender students from restrooms and locker rooms obamas announcement while not technically a change in government policy operated like a shot across the bow to all schools  whether or not they currently enrolled any trans students  and all but ensured a broadbased court challenge to his administrations position on title ix the legislative history of title ix reveals no intent to include gender identity within the meaning of sex the lawsuit reads the term sex as used in title ix and its implementing regulations means male and female under the traditional binary conception of sex consistent with ones genes and anatomy in the court battles that have unfolded so far the government and its interpretation has tended to prevail in april a transgender boy who sued his school in virginia gavin grimm won a key such battle before the fourth circuit court of appeals the judges rejected a lower court argument that title ix allows schools to maintain separate bathrooms based on sex where sex means the gender assigned at birth based on anatomy the uncontroverted facts before the district court demonstrate that as a result of the boards restroom policy grimm experiences daily psychological harm that puts him at risk for longterm psychological harm the fourth circuit ruled more news topics
