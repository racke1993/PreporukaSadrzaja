was game over i always thought i probably needed therapy but never had time texting a therapist was efficient and cheap but soon it was one winking emoji too many text therapy i didnt immediately realize the greatest drawback you cant choose your therapist illustration joanna gniady angelina chapin saturday 9 july 2016 1100bst last modified on saturday 9 july 2016 1101bst share on facebook share on twitter share via email share on linkedin share on google share on whatsapp share on messenger my friends regularly tell me i should be in therapy im a workaholic with crippling decision anxiety i can turn the simple choice of whether to take a flight at 245pm or 430pm into a weeklong deliberation that morphs into a meditation on my flaws as a human being i constantly doubt my own intelligence and often put in longer hours than necessary to compensate for my low selfesteem in sum my friends are probably right but since im busy with a fulltime job and many freelance assignments selfcare usually takes a backseat to work if i cant find 20 minutes for the elliptical i cant find three hours a week to spill my problems while sprawled on plush furniture so when i heard about text therapy which allows you to message a counsellor via phone while you answer an email and eat lunch at your desk i signed up for 100 a month at talkspace one of the many apps that offers digital therapy i could chat in realtime with a therapist for half an hour a week we usually went way over time the price is right  a typical onehour long inperson session can cost between 100 and 300  but i had reservations about my 30day experiment the solution to any workaholics problem is never more screen time and just like the 10minute pilates videos i watch on youtube this seemed like another halfassed attempt to take care of myself yet i never paused to worry about what kind of therapist actually believes they can solve complex mental health issues with the most surface form of communication at first things started out well i was paired with a woman ill call barbara based on talkspaces matching process we covered the basics she asked questions such as have you ever thought about where these thoughts about yourself come from in your life how long have you noticed these type of feelings of inferiority and i responded in large blocks of text in which i made connections to my childhood and admitted that i rarely feel as smart as the people around me i knew it was therapy 101 but it felt powerful to write down the issues that i usually trivialize the first major red flag with barbara was her use of emojis in the early days text therapy was a great spot treatment for my decision anxiety one afternoon barbara talked me through the paralyzing choice of whether or not to attend an awards show in toronto over the course of a few weeks i had exhausted my boyfriend friends and family with my inability to say yes or no just without thinking about right or wrong  what do you want barbara asked the question made me think clearly and led to the breakthrough that i rarely trust my own intuition because well i dont really like myself so my pocket therapist could troubleshoot small problems but i quickly discovered she could not tackle the roots of my low selfesteem the first major red flag with barbara was her use of emojis after our second session in which i listed my many negative qualities she said my longterm mission was to accept myself  a statement she ended with a winking face i tried to stay cool i told myself its 2016 and bright yellow faces are a valid form of expression even for a paid therapist but then i remembered she had already used a few lols and the meaningless phrase i truly believe that the authenticity of our true self is in our life story and i seriously began to question her intelligence i realized that if i didnt bring barbara a specific problem to solve she became a selfcare bot at the end of one session she recommended i buy an interactive journal from amazon that features inspirational quotes to help readers appreciate the world around us and achieve our dreams she sent me worksheets with kindergartenlike prompts such as i like myself because and cheesy ted talks to help replace my negative thoughts with positive daily mantras when i tried to explain that journalists tend to be cynics she responded pride in being a skeptic that is an interesting thing can you explain that a bit more for me oh barbara i thought we will never bridge this divide once i realized her and i werent simpatico i stopped prioritizing our sessions as we texted i kept working with 19 tabs open and threw in my own platitudes such as how can i better accept myself to keep the conversation moving at one point i even began using punctuation like an overly enthusiastic mother when she suggested i take 30 minutes away from the screen for lunch a suggestion i could find on any subpar lifestyle blog i responded okay will do i will suppress my anxiety that i am wasting time her response was even more embarrassing lol how about release your anxiety and give yourself permission to enjoy time just a slight rephrasing a few times i was overwhelmed with work and blew barbara off she bailed once or twice on me as well i never felt guilty because unlike an office visit our appointments were easy to reschedule she usually responded to my cancellations with a classic winking emoji perhaps barbara was just matching her message to the medium maybe shes decided clients who pay less for mental health than for takeout deserve little more than oprahesque cliches maybe she was doing her own juggling cutting and pasting sappy slogans to me and five other clients while she sipped a martini and got a pedicure but the world of text therapy likely attracts a certain kind of counsellor the optimists who believe staring at a poster with the words you are enough below a sunset can alter brain chemistry in our final session i thanked barbara and she wished me well her final text was a smiley face more features topics psychology share on facebook share on twitter share via email share on linkedin share on google
