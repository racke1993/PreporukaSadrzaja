linkedin share on google share on whatsapp share on messenger julian barnes i recently reread anita brookners first novel a start in life penguin and it left me thinking that maybe all novelists should be forbidden from publishing until they are 53 that way they would already have a finished style and a mature cogent individual view of the world this nearly faultless novel also reflects on the competing truthfulness of balzac versus dickens balzac died at 51 so the brookner rule cant apply to him but for the moment i am engrossed in svetlana alexievichs extraordinary secondhand time fitzcarraldo an oral tapestry of postsoviet russia sara baume solar bones tramp by mike mccormack is the monologue of an ordinary man which  skilfully gradually tenderly  discredits the meaning of ordinariness a novel without a single full stop it is easily the most allconsuming and splendid sentence i have ever read mia gallagher is another irish writer who deserves greater attention from overseas her second novel is as rich in texture as it is vast in reach beautiful pictures of the lost homeland new island is made up of several voices from an elderly womans memories of 1940s bohemia to a troubled transsexual in contemporary dublin cynthia bond these two books yanked me in and pulled me under with their first paragraphs i cannot wait to swim with them deep into the summer the tusk that did the damage by tania james vintage an elephant a poacher a collision of desperate needs this novel is going to destroy me completely  i cannot wait an unnecessary woman rabih alameddine corsair i adore rabih alameddine now its out i am preparing for a soulful brilliant spiced and incredibly delicious feast william boyd treat yourself to a blast of poetry this summer anyone remotely interested in the art form should read craig raines wonderful my grandmothers glass eye a look at poetry atlantic feisty provocative learned passionate  it is a seminal lasting work and then two poets to follow up jamie mckendricks magnificent intricate profound selected poems faber clearly establishes him as a modern master and a first collection from sarah howe loop of jade chatto shows that new voices can still carry their own unique freight of subtle music married to acute intelligence it looks like a good summer for books about america by women which i hope will serve as a distraction from reality sarah churchwell it looks like a good summer for stories about america by women which i hope will serve as a distraction from political realities that keep outstripping fiction first i cannot wait to read the theoretical foot bloomsbury the only novel by the great american food writer mfk fisher a story of americans abroad in the late 1930s against the backdrop of the coming war is right up my street ann patchetts commonwealth due in september from bloomsbury is the latest novel from a writer ive long admired ive heard it described as her masterpiece telling the story of an american family over the last five decades its title nods to our endangered commonweal hannah kohlers first novel the outside lands comes garlanded with praise from writers including lionel shriver who must be viewed as something of a onewoman tough crowd what sets it apart is that this story of an american family riven by the vietnam war has been written by a young british woman who wasnt even born when the action of her story takes place finally lionel shrivers brilliant satire of america the mandibles a family 20292047 borough offers a prophetic glance at the dangers into which toxic governments can lead us in the few months since publication events are already proving her right which is frankly terrifying marion coutts max porters grief is the thing with feathers faber is a compact and lovely book porter thinks around the aftermath of loss through three tightknit views a bereaved husband his sons and the volatile character of crow who mediates the experience his writing inside the heads of the young boys is great as ill be spending time in scotland this summer im going to get my hands on another green world encounters with a scottish arcadia by artist alison turnbull with philip hoare artbooks 2015 its a book of drawing text and photography about linn botanical gardens a slice of deep horticultural magic on the rosneath peninsula in argyll juno dawson im currently reading matthew todds straight jacket how to be gay and happy bantam which asks the somewhat controversial question whats wrong with lgbt people this powerful book i believe will save lives id like to see every gay man reading this over the summer ya writers continue to write some of the best  and most overlooked  novels out there and i recommend goldy moldavskys heathersesque kill the boy band macmillan and irish debut author claire hennessys nothing tastes as good hot key a refreshingly original examination of teenage eating disorders related summer reading with mark lawson and lisa mcinerney books podcast reni eddolodge id recommend shrill by lindy west quercus its a perfect antidote to the upcoming summer body tyranny that is directed at women every year at this time of year  she writes about fatness in a way that made me really question the toxicity of diet culture its not just about being fat its about being a fat opinionated woman and the push back she gets for it cal flyns thicker than water william collins is my serious recommendation a meaty read about the tendrils and overhang of british colonialism read it if you want to ask big questions about britain race and responsibility finally im three years late to it but ive just finished chimamanda ngozi adichies americanah 4th estate it was a total joy people recommended it to me because i used to blog about race like the protagonist but its about so much more  love and loss and politics completely engrossing take it on some long train or coach journeys and watch the time fly by yasmine el rashidi i am some way through ben ehrenreichs the way to the spring penguin which is a chillingly beautiful albeit heartbreaking chronicle of palestinian life in the west bank its written with immense empathy but is equally grounded and urgently real im curious about ben lerners the hatred of poetry fitzcarraldo which is a close reading of poetry and why people detest it this from someone who has essentially organised his life around the art i read and admire everything he writes confessions ww norton  company adds to rabee jabers oeuvre of novels that mine his strifetorn country lebanon he expertly excavates history time and again aminatta forna ive heard great things about elnathan johns born on tuesday cassava republic john is a satirical columnist and lawyer in abuja and the novel is the story of a street boy unwittingly caught up in the tumultuous politics of nigeria it sounds like one to read alongside editor ellah allfreys eyeopening collection of nonfiction writing from the african continent safe house cassava republic facebook twitter pinterest margo jefferson photograph mike mcgregor for the observer my top recommendation is the riveting gorgeous poetic insightful winner of the national book award negroland by margo jefferson granta a memoir of growing up posh and black in chicago in the 1950s negroland is a sharpeyed cultural commentary on an era of america that has often been too simply told garth greenwell im not sure how to describe brian blanchfields proxies essays near knowing nightboat a collection of idiosyncratic candid devastating essays except to say that its the most brilliant book ive read in years anyone who has been amazed and rightly so by maggie nelsons the argonauts melville house should read this book posthaste i have been haunted by megan bradburys debut everyone is watching picador ever since i read an early copy months ago through the lives of four historical new yorkers it dramatises more powerfully than any other novel i know the interdependence of artistic making and urban life alexander chees wild opera of a novel the queen of the night michael joseph follows the life of the fictional lilliet berne from the american plains to the great courts of europe passing through prisons and brothels along the way its the perfect summer read swift smart immersive and gorgeous christine grossloh perhaps my very favourite book this year is elizabeth strouts my name is lucy barton it is poignant and spare  we are told little about the narrator  yet we gain the fullest possible picture of her life and her losses through what is left unsaid charles fernyhoughs latest the voices within profile is on my list because it so intriguingly challenges conventional assumptions about the self as unified and coherent while also posing the question how might that which we deem pathological be shaped by the mores of our times tessa hadley i loved david szalays new novel all that man is jonathan cape a darkly comic exploration of masculinity such powerful writing marvellously exact and penetrating  and all about how were mixed up inextricably with the rest of europe apollo have reissued eudora weltys second novel delta wedding and im halfway through its exquisite account of a hazy troubling mississippi summer in the 1920s a little girl whose mother has just died goes to stay with her exuberant cousins on their cotton plantation i cant imagine why i havent read it before as im passionate about weltys writing as a counterpoint to these dark fictional explorations im greatly enjoying the lucid reasoning intelligence and vivid character sketches in english voices simon  schuster a collection of ferdinand mounts essays on literature and history and politics that speaks with depth and sophistication to our political moment sarah hall the book that impressed me most recently was max porters grief is the thing with feathers its an extraordinary book slim potent unquantifiable and extremely companionable especially but not only if the reader has recently been bereaved due to be published in late summer is eimear mcbrides second novel the lesser bohemians faber this is probably one of the most eagerly awaited books of the year after her debut a girl is a halfformed thing shouldered through the ranks of formal normal prose to remind readers what the novel can do in the hands of a truly gifted undaunted visionary writer set in the drama circles of london lit with sexual energy and the quick synaptic power of mcbrides narrative idiom her new work looks set to flex this remarkable talent again and in new ways mohsin hamid the most interesting recently published book i have read so far this year is sapiens a brief history of humankind by yuval noah harari vintage it moves from our prehuman past to ancient human times and on to the present and to our possible posthuman future its provocative and fascinating and opinionated and although it is nonfiction it does something that the best fiction does it makes the familiar seem unfamiliar it altered how i view our species and our world yuval noah harari i picked up joby warricks black flags the rise of isis corgi with a heavy heart dreading that it would be a sensationalist lightweight playing up to western fears and biases it turned out to be a deep wellbalanced and thoughtprovoking account with a genuine feel for middle eastern realities my next pick is serhii plokhys the last empire the final days of the soviet union oneworld whereas the collapse of the communist block was probably inevitable by the late 1980s the collapse of the old russian empire was anything but written like a good thriller the last empire recounts how chance events and quirky personalities led within a few months in 1991 to the disintegration of the empire built and maintained by generations of russian tsars and soviet apparatchiks a recently published book that i plan to read is by frans de waal are we smart enough to know how smart animals are granta de waals chimpanzee politics was one of the most important and hilarious science books i have ever read so i am keen to see what insights his new book might offer about animal behaviour animal cognition and human myopia i love novels that blend fact with fiction so jill dawsons the crime writer sounds right up my street paula hawkins ive been looking forward to the girls chatto emma clines debut set in a hippy commune and drawing loosely on the story of the manson family it has at its heart the intense and sometimes dangerous relationships that blossom between teenage girls i love novels that blend fact with fiction so jill dawsons the crime writer sceptre which reimagines patricia highsmiths escape to the suffolk countryside in 1964 sounds right up my street emma healey first there is my name is lucy barton by elizabeth strout the narrator of this luminous and surprising book is stuck in hospital due to an undiagnosed illness when her emotionally distant but strangely soothing mother comes to visit what follows are snippets of gossip memories and realisations about writing most of which come back to a central theme of mothers and their failures sympathetic subtle and sometimes shocking before i read spqr by mary beard profile there were myths about rome i halfremembered and didnt understand there were senators and emperors i thought were purely fictional there were hundreds of years of republic i hadnt realised were significant brilliant for readers like me whose study of classics was a little stunted or now feels quite distant there are also two books i am dying to finish this summer the first is the essex serpent by sarah perry rich and gorgeous from the first page with a mysteriousness i am desperate to explore the second is everyone is watching by megan bradbury vivid full of deadpan humour and very very unusual rachel holmes i tried really hard to save this for the summer but im as addicted to frances wilsons writing as her latest subject thomas de quincey was to opiates romantic poets and murder guilty thing bloomsbury is an irresistible journey through the life of the obsessive anarchic original flneur borges said de quincey was an almost infinite world of literature in one man wilson succeeds in conjuring this world in one exhilarating rigorous and humorous book that is the most enjoyable journey into hell youre ever likely to take we know now that history is made of multiple individual voices and not grand univocal master narratives but svetlana alexeivich actually knows how to write it that way second handtime is at one of its many levels about what the soviet union was and what its legacy still means alexievich is one of the very small number of nobel literature laureates who are predominantly nonfictioners and reading this book shows why  she writes a new form of history unlike anything that goes before last weekend reading her deep exploration of what a russian world would be without the myths of nationalism i realised i had in my hands a book that transcends its geography and makes it essential reading in brexit britain andrew michael hurley having loved after me comes the flood i cant wait to read sarah perrys latest novel the essex serpent set in the strange marshlands of essex fell by jenn ashworth sceptre is a fantastically dark and unsettling story of healing and hope set in morecambe bay finally himself by jess kidd canongate this debut novel looks to be an intriguing story of family secrets and haunting in the remote west of ireland kazuo ishiguro hisham matars the return fathers sons and the land in between viking is a moving unflinching memoir of a family torn apart by the savage realities of todays middle east the crushing of hopes raised by the arab spring  at both the personal and national levels  is conveyed all the more powerfully because matars anger remains controlled his belief in humanity undimmed graham swifts exquisite brief mothering sunday scribner shows love lust and ordinary decency straining against the bars of an unjust english caste system coming this autumn is a true leftfield wonder sebastian barrys days without end faber is a violent superbly lyrical western offering a sweeping vision of america in the making the most fascinating linebyline first person narration ive come across in years and at its heart a tender gay love story juliet jacques few authors were better at combining the personal and political or twitter than jenny diski she is sorely missed but at least she finished in gratitude bloomsbury her memoir about her time with doris lessing facebook twitter pinterest jenny diski photograph photoshotgetty images well have to wait for the end of summer for suzana tratniks games with greta and

difficulties of moving from girlhood to womanhood in the former yugoslavia jeanphilippe toussaints football fitzcarraldo translated by shaun whiteside offers up my favourite contemporary author writing about my favourite subject as ever its poetic and full of selfdeprecatory humour and touches on a relationship with football in ways that are both recognisable and oblique oliver jeffers on the strength of having recently read annie proulxs the shipping news  a big sweepingly beautiful observation of a man subtly unfolding himself in a wild newfoundland winter might also be a useful read for cooling yourself down on a hot day barkskins 4th estate according to the blurb at the back is about the taking down of the worlds forests no small topic there that should take up a few weeks as a lover of stories both telling and hearing them and a firm believer in the power of storytelling  we are after all little more than the stories we are told the stories we tell and those that are told about us  im enormously looking forward to the view from the cheap seats selected nonfiction headline neil gaimans foray into some of the stories that walk the planet among us both big and small there are so many interesting things that have actually happened its almost a pity to spend your time reading about things that didnt i was first a fan of bill bryson after reading a short history of almost everything which was solidified after reading at home a short history of private life looking at why are homes are built the way they are and using that as a lens to look at some other aspects of human history aptly given to me as i was moving apartment one summer is about the real events that occurred on either side of the atlantic in the summer of 1927 while it mostly concentrates on the american events of that year it includes events in britain and france from the first flight across the atlantic and the epic season of babe ruth to the beginning of the end of prohibition the first ever celebrity murder case the first ever talking picture and the events that would lead the world into a global depression bryson takes all of these seemingly disparate events and weaves them together to brilliantly take a pulse of the times they were as ever bryson has a way of writing that is both extremely humorous and vividly flowing proxies is a collection of essays on sex by brian blanchfield i dipped into frottage and am already hot for more olivia laing ive been desperate to get to the novelist activist and playwright sarah schulmans the cosmopolitans feminist for months ive

the panopticon was my novel of 2013 and her follow up the sunlight pilgrims heinemann about a community in a scottish caravan park during a freak winter is what ill be reading during some time off in

hilary mantel so consider me salivating han kangs the vegetarian was dreamy and nightmarish and easily one of the best booksive read in years also on my summer pile is red dirt head of zeus the debut novel by another compatriot em reapy it promises to be a visceral thriller about the lost irish in australia and i do love a properly uncomfortable literary gutpunch and dont pull at all with the idea that summer reading must be lighter than ones usual diet and on that note ive just finished han kangs the vegetarian portobello translated by deborah smith which was at once dreamy and nightmarish a beautiful horror and easily one of the best books ive read in years pankaj mishra the 19th century was when the contemporary world was decisively shaped for better and worse and the thick galleys of

combined with sombre seriousness its a rich fulfilment of the exceptional promise in his three previous books geoff dyers new instalment of essays white sands canongate which concentrates on notions

and it now takes a special novel to stand out in solar bones mike mccormack takes many stylistic risks and my god do they pay off this is an inventive beautiful book that deserves to be widely read

and im looking forward to a relaxing countryside break with some good books as an illustrator i believe in the power of words and pictures so ive chosen three books that are outstanding examples of this the first is anything that isnt this by chris priestley hot key this is a superbly illustrated ya novel set in an atmospheric kafkaesque european city the 70 gouache illustrations in grey tones are beautifully atmospheric and draw the reader effortlessly into the story alexis deacon is a favourite illustrator of mine and he has written and illustrated one of the best graphic novels ive ever read the pace of the narrating is deft but the frames take my breath away geis nobrow pronounced gesh is a book you can go back to and find new wonders each time the last book on my summer picnic blanket is jim kays sublimely illustrated edition of jk rowlings harry potter and the philosophers stone bloomsbury jim is an illustration wizard and this is a beautiful spellbinding book jacqueline rose firstly eimear mcbrides the lesser bohemians there will come a time when anyone wanting to understand the deep physical and psychic impact of sexual abuse will read mcbride this is the brilliant troubling mustread of the summer walter benjamin the foremost marxist cultural critic of the 20th century is not best known for his literary writing so much praise is due to the editors for bringing together a newly translated collection of his short fictions the story teller verso in which he shows our iniquitous material world suffused and sabotaged by the uncanny like no one else facebook twitter pinterest seamus heaney photograph suttonhibbertrexshutterstock finally seamus heaneys translation of aeneid book vi faber despite the poems imperial moments heaney manages to align its voice

in ghana the other captured and sold as a slave in america in considering the divergent lives of their descendants gyasi confronts those thorny questions of culpability and identity that still plague the african diasporic community tedious as i find the geopolitical classification of novelists i well understand why alejandro zambra is described as latin americas new literary star his latest multiple choice granta could be called an experimental novella written in the form of a multiple choice examination specifically the chilean version of the sats brilliant innovative beautiful  david marksons vanishing point meets junot dazs this is how you lose her elif shafak at the top of my summer reading choices is hisham matars the return i have always admired matars tender and compassionate but equally strong and compelling voice a sons search for his father and a sense of belonging the tension between homeland and exile and the mixture of the personal with the political  they all appeal to me another book that i am looking forward to reading is the badass librarians of timbuktu and their race to save the worlds most precious manuscripts by joshua hammer simon  schuster timbuktu was once a cultural hub and a centre for ideas creativity and books both in arabic and african languages hammer highlights the clash between two opposing interpretations of islam  those who want to destroy free thinking and pluralism and those who are determined to save the libraries the wisdom of centuries from such fanatics i would also recommend everyone to read the new odyssey the story of europes refugee crisis guardian faber patrick kingsley has given us a powerful evocative book lionel shriver for those who savour indignation one of my favourite emotions mark lawsons the allegations is great fun and it provides at least the illusion of an inside track on the nonfiction backstory i loved mark haddons the pier falls whose title story is either perfect beach reading or perfectly terrible beach reading depending on your level of perversity deborah smith one of the best books ive read in recent months has also been one of the best translations in ladivine maclehose the latest collaboration between marie ndiaye and translator jordan stump the injection of the bizarre and uncanny renders a multigenerational womencentric saga both mesmerising and faintly sickening in 2011

interrailing through berlin and prague and moves on to a jobless young frenchman who pitches up alone at a shabby hotel in cyprus its funny sharp unsettling with flashes of joy  a perfect book to take travelling marcel theroux a nonfiction book about the breakup of a multiethnic state and the identity crisis that followed tops my list secondhand time is a series of firstperson testimonies from the former soviet union woven into a stunning chorale by svetlana alexievich thomas morriss debut story collection we dont know what were doing faber is mordantly funny and achingly true the characters

and ambivalence of family life colm tibn the mandibles is a gleeful nightmare it made me snort with laughter even as i was shuddering mike mccormack has always been among the most adventurous and ambitious irish writers his novel solar bones written in one single sonorous sentence tells the story of a family in contemporary ireland the way to the spring life and death in palestine by ben ehrenreich penguin is a result of three years spent going back and forth to the west bank living in the cities and villages it promises to be a good companion piece to dervla murphys a month by the sea encounters in gaza eland and her between river and sea encounters in israel and palestine eland in which one of the wisest travel writers working now casts her penetrating eye on daily life in the middle east i found hisham matars the return in which he tells the story of his fathers arrest and disappearance in libya riveting sarah walker ive just finished reading ladivine by french author marie ndiaye maclehose i cant remember the last time a novel cast a spell over me like this one did this story of three generations of women is a mesmerizing exploration of identity mixing mystery and magical realism in completely unexpected ways the less you know about it in advance the better the next novel im looking forward to reading is louise erdrichs larose corsair in which an ojibwe man on a reservation in north dakota accidentally shoots and kills his neighbors son and subsequently offers up his own child as a replacement im not normally an avid memoir reader but im eager to pick up susan faludis in the darkroom william collins her memoir about her abusive father who undergoes sex reassignment surgery late in life ill read anything faludi writes and i cant think of anyone better to consider contemporary debates about identity through a feminist lens sarah waters three new novels have impressed me this summer jill dawsons the crime writer has patricia highsmith as its heroine its inspired by the years that the thriller writer spent in suffolk in the early 1960s and is fantastically moody and appealingly unhinged  a piece of sophisticated literary ventriloquism that achieves a wonderful blurring of the lines between fact and fantasy natasha walters a quiet life borough is based on the figure of melinda marling wife of the cambridge spy donald maclean its a troubling understated novel almost hypnotic in the completeness with which it inhabits the mind of its impressionable central character lionel shrivers the mandibles a family 20292047 is set in the near future a posteconomicmeltdown us in which the privileged classes have to fight for stunned survival as civilisation slowly unravels around them a gleeful nightmare it made me snort with laughter
