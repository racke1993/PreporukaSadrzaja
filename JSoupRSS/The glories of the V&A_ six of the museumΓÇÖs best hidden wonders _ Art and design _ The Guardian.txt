the va in south kensington london this great victorian creation which has just been named museum of the year attracts huge audiences for its blockbuster exhibitions on the likes of alexander mcqueen and kylie minogue beyond those glamorous events however its real strength is as a vast cabinet of curiosities full of almost limitless surprises its collections contain everything from porcelain goats to a hello kitty lunchbox all waiting to be discovered among what feels like miles of sometimes labyrinthine sometimes awesomely grand galleries here is a magical mystery tour of some of the museums lesserknown wonders lou reed concert poster 1973 huge audiences visited the innovative exhibition david bowie is in 2013 but this was just the tip of a popculture iceberg posters for longpast live performances can be found in its theatre department along with mick jaggers incredibly tightfitting jumpin jack flash stage suit and an installation that recreates kylie minogues dressing room this image of druggy bisexual rock genius lou reed is based on the cover of his 1972 album transformer the deliberately vulgar discostyle lettering and raw look of the poster perfectly reflect the vicious feedback and protopunk aggression of reeds concerts in the early 70s he hit them with a flower bust of thomas baker by gian lorenzo bernini c1638 facebook twitter pinterest some of the most majestic sculptures in the world can be seen at the va from sensual terracotta models that still preserve renaissance artist giambolognas fingerprints to smoothly erotic marbles by the neoclassicist canova but this is my favourite although it was sculpted in 17thcentury rome its in the british galleries baker a courtier of charles i took a portrait of his king to rome so the great sculptor bernini could base a bust on it while there he posed for this frolicsome portrait which recreates the delicacy of his lace collar and soft cavalier hair only bernini could carve a hairstyle as buoyant as this out of rock the william morris room green dining room in the va cafe facebook twitter pinterest even the cafe has its secret treasures although the days are long gone when it notoriously advertised itself as a nice cafe with a museum attached in fact the high quality of its catering facilities goes back to the victorian age it has three grand victorian dining rooms still very much in use of which the most dimly lit and least spectacular is by far the most artistically important the green dining room as it should properly be called was created by william morris and company and expresses the victorian marxist designers desire to return to a monastic medieval community its deep dreamcoloured walls and stainedglass windows create a sombre mood perfect for thinking about all the amazing stuff youve just seen or recovering from a crowded blockbuster show about shoes leonardo da vincis notebooks 1480s to early 1500s facebook twitter pinterest the notebooks of leonardo da vinci are among the greatest treasures of the human mind his tiny handwriting scribbled from right to left in an attempt at secret code is juxtaposed with page after page of diagrams of pulleys designs for flying machines and illustrations of the anatomical dissections he did at a florentine hospital the va owns five of these extraordinary books unlike his manuscripts in the royal collection or milans ambrosian library they are still in their original calfskin bindings even more amazingly the museum puts them in rotation on free public display regency evening dress c1810 facebook twitter pinterest the va has fantastic fashion collections but they dont just cover celebrated modern designers nor are clothes restricted to the fashion galleries this wellpreserved english evening dress from the age of jane austen is on view in the new europe galleries which helped the museum pick up its welldeserved gong the dresss slender waist almost seethrough flimsiness and fiery red hue prove that fashion could be as daring 200 years ago as it is in the age of alexander mcqueen it invites you to imagine who wore it  a reallife character from a gothic novel a woman out of an ingres portrait a debutante at the ball on the eve of waterloo history comes alive through objects like this head of the buddha afghanistan 300400 ad facebook twitter pinterest one of the most surprising collections in this treasury of world art is a remarkable group of buddhist sculptures associated with the ancient gandhara culture which show how artistic influences spread between east and west nearly 2000 years ago this image of the buddha strongly resembles the disciplined harmonious realism of ancient greek art at first it seems like coincidence  then you examine other sculptures near it and see the clear influence of grecoroman art more features topics va museums share on facebook share on twitter share via email share on linkedin share on google share on whatsapp share on messenger reuse this content
