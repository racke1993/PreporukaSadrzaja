poetry point of view there is more to war poetry than mud wire and slaughter andrew motion poems about the first world war have defined the genre for decades it is time to hear from new voices that reflect a wider view of conflicts british troops advancing during the battle of el alamein 1942 photograph csu archiveseverett collectrex saturday 9 july 2016 1100bst share on facebook share on twitter share via email share on linkedin share on google share on whatsapp share on messenger when we say war poetry today the sort of writing that comes to mind is a conglomeration of wilfred owen siegfried sassoon and the other great writers of the first world war it means descriptions of mud wire and slaughter on a horrific scale it includes accusations that the top brass prolonged hostilities for no good reason and that people at home supported the cause inignorance it involves fierce protest as well as intense sympathy itissues awarning because poetry of this sort has been dripfed into british schools for several generations interestingly the process did not start as soon as the war ended but only began in earnest during the 1960s it has settled in the public mind at an extraordinary depth there are large benefits of course the best poetry of the first world war is exceptionally powerful  not just the lyrics ofowen and others but the more complex and modernistic narrative of inparenthesis by david jones which still hassome claim to be considered aneglected masterpiece furthermore by rubbing its readers noses in the brutal facts of conflict and suffering itpossibly creates a social value as well  by helping to educate people in the human cost of war and in the process discouraging them from starting or supporting another one related in parenthesis in praise of the sommes forgotten poet at the same time maybe there are disadvantages perhaps by placing such an emphasis on war poetry in the school curriculum we dont actually put people off the idea of fighting but inculcate the idea that it is somehow normal for the british to take up arms perhaps it solidifies the idea of us as awarlike nation there is a literary consequence to the classroom focus too by concentrating on the poetry ofone conflict which to an important extent is shaped by its particular circumstances it directs attention away from the poetry of other wars not just the poetry of other wars in fact but other kinds of war poetry i am the enemy you killed my friend says the dead soldier encountered in owens strange meeting i parried but my hands were loath and cold this summarises the whole circumstance of first world war poetry it often involved handtohand fighting it was intimate the second world war by contrast wasfor many soldiers a more distanced affair keith douglas when taking aim in his poem how to kill says now in my dial of glass appears the soldier who is going to die he stillthinks of him as a fellow creature the soldier moves about in ways  hismother knows habits of his but also feels acrucial separation  a gap that exists as a physical space and proves the conflict has frozen orexterminated apart of the speakers own humanity the difference between these two poems is shorthand for the differences between two periods and two kinds ofwar poetry it is also an opportunity to point out that while the owen poem has been read by millions of schoolchildren in the last 50odd years the douglas poem which is just as good ifnot better has been read by a handful by not conforming to the pattern of war poetry laid down between 1914 and 1918 actually between about 1916and 1918 it has been sidelined facebook twitter pinterest the contemporary american poet yusef komunyakaa who has written poems about vietnam photograph james keysertime  life picturesgetty image the point here is not to discredit poetry of the first world war as a collective act of witness made at an extraordinary level of technical skill and with equally extraordinary emotional power it is in its terrible way magnificent thepoint rather is to say that our definition of war poetry has become too narrow to be accurate or fair by extending it we are not only able to make alarge literary gain  by admiringamuch wider range of expertise thoughtfulness and compassion  but also to appreciate in even more varied and detailed ways the effects of war this applies to the first world war itself if we look away from the frontline and move to the homefront poetry of men in uniform such as edward thomas or women waiting for them such as eleanor farjeon or to the extraordinary reports by nurses and other volunteers such as helen mackay may wedderburn cannan and margaret postgate cole or to the visceral and protoexistentialist poems and songs and chants of anonymous i dont want a bayonet up my arsehole  idontwant my bollocks shot away a glance across the landscape of war poetry written after 1918 gives an even more dramatic sense of variety the frontline in north africa then france brilliantly evoked by douglas  inhis poetry as well as his memoir alamein to zem zem  is just a part of the large picture in which also appears alun lewis writing about soldierly boredom and nervous waiting during the second world war and dylan thomas writing about the blitz  and around them international voices speaking with and through and over them nelly sachs paul celan anna akhmatova and tadeusz rewicz related top 10 war poems as we come towards the present day our sense of dilation becomes even greater not just in the sense that poets have made farflung wars visible at home yusef komunyakaa writing about vietnam for instance or brian turner about iraq but also because the reporting of wars in the media hasencouraged noncombatants to address the subject in greater numbers than ever before this is a difficult business since it is all too easy to get caught grandstanding or parading sensitivities or seeming to aggrandise oneself by associating with a grand subject but when it is done well it produces poems that earn the right tosit besides those written by people in uniform tony harrisons acold coming for example or james fentons dead soldiers before the first world war war poetry since time immemorial the iliad had been largely concerned to celebrate commend remember and yes grieve think of lord byrons assyrian coming down like a wolf on the fold or sir john moore in charles wolfes poem about the battle of corunna since 1918 like war itself the poetry of conflict has become athing of infinite variety describing apparently infinite tragedy yet for all this  which deserves more acknowledgment than it gets  something has stayed the same the something owen meant when he spoke about the pity  ten war poems edited
