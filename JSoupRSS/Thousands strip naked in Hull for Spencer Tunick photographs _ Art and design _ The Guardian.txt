posed in historic locations facebook twitter pinterest nude models prepare to pose for a photograph by us artist spencer tunick for a project titled sea of hull photograph andrew yatesreuters tunick said it had been one of the best turnouts he has seen for one of his shoots and the best in the uk beating gateshead in 2005 and salford in 2010 i needed about 2500 to 3000 volunteers to do this work and 3200 came i was incredibly lucky to be able to fill up streets into the distance he said volunteers arrived at the meeting point in the city centre at 3am they then stripped off and helped to paint each other the crowds were then ordered into position through megaphones by tunicks assistants who he calls nude wranglers during the threehour photo shoot tunick said the crowds of blue people were also a representation of the rising sea levels caused by climate change its the idea that the bodies and humanity is flooding the streets he said so there are many ways you can think about it i was very surprised to see so many older people take part and so many people who had problems walking  with wheelchairs crutches leg braces it was like the end of a war in a way but they were resilient and we had young and old and i am so thankful to them facebook twitter pinterest models on the scale lane swing bridge over the river hull photograph andrew yatesreuters theres something about the body and how its juxtaposed with public space  the natural soft vulnerable body thats up against the concrete world  it creates a dynamic that interests me one volunteer was stephane janssen 80 from the us who has posed for tunick 20 times i always say that its the least sexual thing that ive ever seen in my life he said we are naked but it is not important we are equal big people small people all colours all walks of life he said he did get a little chilly during the shoot but added it was nothing compared to tunicks installation in dublin in the summer of 2008 that was frightening he said my children are very conservative they dont think its totally proper to have their fathers butt on a museum wall but i love it janssen said it will be the last time he takes part in one of tunicks
