steve cummings wins after solo break video highlights supported by nederburg wine william fotheringham in lac de payolle friday 8 july 2016 1612bst last modified on friday 8 july 2016 2345bst share on facebook share on twitter share via email share on linkedin share on google share on whatsapp share on messenger in the last 12 months steve cummings has turned into one of the most efficient hunters of stage wins in the increasingly structured  some would say sterile  world of 21stcentury cycling where riders adopt fixed roles and race to order each of the wirral riders five victories in worldtour races in the last 12 months has combined the same ingredients stunning tactical sense a nose for an opportunity and the singleminded ability to target the days in a stage race that suit him the most since he outwitted romain bardet and thibaut pinot to win the tour stage at mende last year cummings has added further stage wins in tirrenoadriatico the tour of the basque country and the critrium du dauphin like his win in the dauphin his victory here came at the end of a solo escape over the final climb  in this case the col daspin  and was thought through at a level which will surprise those who think cycling is a matter of merely pressing hard on the pedals there were two key moments here both worthy of inclusion in any coaching video having worked his way into the 29rider lead group that gained five minutes and would decide the stage win  i read it well felt it didnt have to try too hard  on the runin to the aspin cummings identified the key split  dani navarro of cofidis matti breschel of cannondale and antoine duchesne of direct energie  by merit of the fact that they were all from teams with more than one rider in the group so their teammates would obstruct the chase he made his solo move as the quartet was about to be overhauled by a chase group driven by the 2014 tour winner vincenzo nibali and the yellow jersey greg van avermaet knowing that he had to get to the aspin in front i was cooking on the climb he said i thought vincenzo would come back to me  nibali looked in better shape than on wednesday but his chasing efforts proved fruitless  for a moment i thought of waiting and trying to do him in the sprint but i was worried he would just come past you have to commit to the decision youve made given his proven ability to snatch a win in almost any tactical situation it seems a travesty that he will not figure in the great britain team in the olympic road race on a climbers course which would suit his talents having called for the coach rod ellingworth to resign over the decision cummings said he has now moved on you have to deal with the disappointment the tour is the greatest show on earth and if you can have success here thats much bigger for any professional bike rider than any olympic games he does have an olympic medal to his name having taken a silver in the team pursuit at the athens olympics alongside bradley wiggins he had picked up sporadic victories over the years before in 2010 team sky earmarked him as wigginss assistant in the mountains but he never quite fitted in with the british teams highly structured approach the turning point was his arrival last year at mtnqubeka  now dimension data  where the manager brian smith gave him the freedom to race as he wanted ive always had talent but sometimes you can be in the wrong team or just riding for a general classification rider and you dont get the opportunities its hard to get in the tour in some of those teams let alone have a free ride and interpret the race as you see it dimension data have given me freedom opportunity and belief mende was the dream afterwards i didnt know what to do i was lost for months im not a confident person but i watch it sometimes although it makes me feel funny i have a little video collage i watch when i dont feel so good cummingss philosophy is to hide and save his strength on days when he is not interested which many teams find impossible to accommodate here he was however prominent on the front across brittany on stage two in defence of mark cavendishs yellow jersey now cavendish and cummings between them have given the african squad four stage wins out of a possible seven in the tours first week van avermaets presence in the escape was a cunning plan worthy of baldrick with the difference that it worked rather than defend the yellow jersey on the aspin he wanted to gain time before the climb he finished the stage with a margin of 1min 25sec on the  surprisingly large  main peloton that clung together around chris froome and nairo quintana and extended his lead to six and a half minutes he knows however that over saturdays four massive passes including the col du tourmalet and the col de peyresourde his time should finally be up van avermaet will not be the only one fearing the road to luchon although froome and the other favourites held a watching brief on the aspin others were watching from the wrong end of the peloton french euphoria after les bleus triumph over germany lasted until just before 5pm when with 4km left to the summit of the aspin pinot the nations favourite to take its first tour win in 31 years slipped painfully off the back of the peloton disturbingly the pressure was not on with the peloton still numbering about 60 riders spread out across the tarmac alberto contador for one after his travails in the week will have been relieved that sky and movistar opted for a truce at the finish pinot had lost over three minutes and had the look of a puppy who has been bullied by an older bigger dog pas bon tout simplement needed no translation my season has turned to dust the objective is dead his tour is not over but it is
