move and has pushed out ahead of martin and pinot who have been thoroughly caught by the pack now and are in the process of blending into that pack facebook twitter google plus share share this post facebook twitter google plus close 259pm bst 1459 theyre approaching the third of the four climbs the col de val louronazet its 107km and with a 63 average slope is it a slope more of a hill or a mountain facebook twitter google plus share share this post facebook twitter google plus close 254pm bst 1454 and now the gap is down to 55 seconds theyve been reeled in by team sky et al which does seem slightly curious majka pinot and martin probably arent going to be among those challenging at the end so expending a lot of energy in chasing them down is a tad odd no unless the front three have just slowed down colossally facebook twitter google plus share share this post facebook twitter google plus close 248pm bst 1448 the team sky group are still chipping away at the leading trio theyre

1444 theyre now over the crest of la hourquette danzican or at least the three leaders are with pinot bagging the five points majka three and martin two two more climbs to go in the 64km remaining but

honkingly hot out there as they climb towards the hourquette danzican were talking low 30s so you wonder how pinot for example will cope with that hes not a fan of such weather particularly one would imagine when cycling up a bloody great hill facebook twitter google plus share share this post facebook twitter google plus close 208pm bst 1408 terrific work from tony price here ive just noticed being a tad slow that there is a sebastien reichenbach in the frame would it take sherlock to work out the headline if he came off his bike facebook twitter google plus share share this post facebook

httpstco8nwdmzkevv facebook twitter google plus share share this post facebook twitter google plus close 200pm bst 1400 the leading trio have extended their lead to about 240 now thats majka pinot and martin if you cant be bothered to scroll down a few entries facebook twitter google plus share share this post facebook twitter google plus close 157pm bst 1357 the peloton which includes froome and quintana is currently about 217 behind the leaders and if youre keeping track of nibalis movements hes a further 3 minutes behind that along with julian alaphilippe facebook twitter google plus share share this post facebook twitter google plus close 153pm bst 1353 the riders are belting down the descent with martin having rejoined majka and pinot up top but theres another climb in about 4km time thats an 82km climb with an average gradient of 42 facebook twitter google plus share share this post facebook twitter google plus close 149pm bst 1349 points who wants some points pinot bagged himself 25 for reaching the col first while majka receives 20 and martin tucks 16 into his back pocket speaking of back pockets pinot wins the souvenir jacquesgoddet for which he receives 5000 better than a kick in the swingers and no mistake meanwhile i have a threecheese macaroni cant confirm what the cheeses are though nothing bluemaybe parmesan is involved facebook twitter google plus share

seconds back facebook twitter google plus share share this post facebook twitter google plus close 128pm bst 1328 theyre approaching the top of the rather spectacular col du tourmalet now pinot majka and martin have pulled nearly two minutes ahead of the pack while vincenzo nibali has dropped off the back of the peloton facebook twitter google plus share share this post facebook twitter google plus close 124pm bst 1324 heres more from zachary gompertsmitchelson on aesthetics so obviously when considering aesthetics its only fair to consider the cyclists in their element of the sprinters ive always liked the smaller ones caleb ewan looks like an actual torpedo whereas kittel and gripel look like bulls passing melons all that power is quite exciting though quintana just looks right on a hill like the figurative mountain goat if mountain goats could glide although it does seem unfair that froomes weird style seems to turn the snobs against his achievements facebook twitter google plus share share this post facebook twitter google plus close 119pm bst 1319 just over 103 km of the total 184km remaining of this stage majka and pinot surprisingly still lead facebook twitter google plus share share this post facebook twitter google plus close 110pm bst 1310 pinot and rafal majka have pulled ahead now  theyre about 20 seconds clear of martin and jeannesson who in turn are a little clear of the main group featuring the big names facebook twitter google plus share share this post facebook twitter google plus close 107pm bst 1307 back to the important matter of the day and who looks the best while cycling and jim brown is after some balance whilst it is important to recognise style cyclists its also important to recognise those who were left on the line whilst the pretty ones were being picked thomas voeckler going up hill tony martin going down hill and andre greipel poor lad facebook twitter google plus share share this post facebook twitter google plus close 103pm bst 1303 tony martin is up top too but jeannesson has now dropped back a little meanwhile the results of the intermediate sprint 1 michael matthews 20 pts 2 mikal chrel 17 pts 3 jasper stuyven 15 pts 4 stef clement 13 pts 5 paul voss 11 pts 6 tom dumoulin 10 pts 7 dylan van baarle 9 pts 8 romain sicard 8 pts 9 luis leon sanchez 7 pts 10 jesus herrada 6 pts 11 dani navarro 5 pts 12 ilnur zakarin 4

the col du tourmalet now which is where the incline gets particularly spicy a new breakaway group has formed including thibaut pinot who presumably hasnt stopped for crumpets with the vicar julian alaphilippe and arnold jeannesson the rest of the overall leaders remain in the peloton facebook twitter google plus share share this post facebook twitter google plus close 1253pm bst 1253 heres a wee history lesson from a past tour stage that also ended in luchon as this one does via andrew benton heres the race in 1953 with dutch commentary so ive no idea what is being said  cauterets to luchon section is about 3115  3700 mins the riders approaching luchon with the inner tubes around their shoulders 3615ish and later really have style great false moustaches at the beginning of the film too facebook twitter google plus share share this post facebook twitter google plus close 1243pm bst 1243 a breakaway a bold trio of dani navarro samuel dumoulin and mikael chrel have moved a little clear of the pack facebook twitter google plus share share this post facebook twitter google plus close 1235pm bst 1235 the peloton has reached the 55km point still bunched together 10km to go before the intermediate sprint facebook twitter google plus share share this post facebook twitter google plus close 1227pm bst 1227 a very thorough answer on aesthetics from zachary gompertsmitchelson to your aesthetics question the answer is absolutely yes there is even a name for it those that look nice on the bike might be described as a pedaleur de charme although the cycling podcast gives its pedaleur de charme award to either the most honourable quirky or hardest trying rider of the day to keep it within confines of the great british brexit sadness woe for a start look no further than britains two tour winners bradley wiggins is an aesthetes dream his position on the bike perfect every metronomic pedal stroke symetrical across his body even and forever froome on the other hand pedals like a man with the shivers holding a circular saw while all opinions on how charme a pedaleur might be are subjective there are like federer certain riders we can all agree on sagan going down a hill for instance is pure art facebook twitter google plus share share this post facebook twitter google plus close 1225pm bst 1225 no huge dramas in the peloton so far peter sagan broke away from the pack briefly but everything has bunched up a little now michael morkov  in last place after yesterday  seems to be having some injury problems though facebook twitter google plus share

plus share share this post facebook twitter google plus close 1216pm bst 1216 on aestheticallypleasing cyclists heres colin mackay i have always liked the way that contador seems to spend most of his time out of the saddle makes him seem preternaturally energetic a natural cyclist by the same token froome looks awkward always staring down fixated on his power meter facebook twitter google plus

time its fantastic to pass near my house unfortunately i wont have time to stop because its a very difficult stage today quite like the idea that if it wasnt a very difficult stage hed maybe stop at his mams for a brew facebook twitter google plus share share this post facebook twitter google plus close 1209pm bst 1209 heres a question for greater cycling scholars than i is there such a thing as a cycling stylist someone who cycles in an aesthetically pleasing manner the pedalling equivalent of roger federer or david gower as opposed to milos raonic or gary ballance and if so what makes them

welcome to stage eight of the tour de france hills then big hills there were some hills yesterday today there are more hills big hills the riders start at pau before getting thoroughly stuck into a big chunk of the pyrenees which is about the point that more learned people than your humble correspondent expect current yellow jerseysporter greg van avermaet to be thanked for his service and slink back into the pack as yer man william fotheringham wrote in his report of stage seven he knows however that over saturdays four massive passes including the col du tourmalet and the col de peyresourde his time should finally be up some of the big names are quite wellplaced  your froomes your quintanas  but one man seems to have taken a poor showing rather badly and turned to larkinesque poetry to

facebook twitter google plus close 1025am bst 1025 nick will be here soon enough until then relive stage seven read william fotheringhams report from lac de payolle as britains steve cummings recorded his second tour de france stage win of his career in the last 12 months steve cummings has turned into one of the most efficient hunters of stage wins in the increasingly structured  some would say sterile  world of 21stcentury cycling where riders adopt fixed roles and race to order each of the wirral riders five victories in worldtour races in the last 12 months has combined the same ingredients stunning tactical sense a nose for an opportunity and the singleminded ability to target the days in a stage race that suit him the most since he outwitted romain bardet and thibaut pinot to win the tour stage at mende last year cummings has added further stage wins in tirrenoadriatico the tour of the basque country and the critrium du dauphin like his win in the dauphin his victory here came at the end of a solo escape over the final climb  in this case the col daspin  and was thought through at a level which will surprise those who think cycling is a matter of merely pressing
