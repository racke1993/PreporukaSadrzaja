trident trident vote to be held before the end of july cameron confirms prime minister announces that vote to renew the controversial defence programme will take place on 18 july british navy

share on twitter share via email share on linkedin share on google share on whatsapp share on messenger david cameron has announced a parliamentary vote on the renewal of the trident nuclear deterrent in just over a week as he seeks to unite the feuding conservative party and exploit divisions in labour the outgoing prime minister said the vote on replacing four ageing vanguard submarines will take place on monday 18 july before parliament breaks up for summer recess he is pressing ahead even though his conservative successor has not yet been chosen as there is broad agreement within his party about renewal of trident at a time of bitter infighting over europe the timing of the vote will also be seen as an attempt to highlight labours split on the issue as jeremy corbyn is against maintaining the nuclear deterrent while most of his party is in favour it is certain to inflame tensions as corbyn faces the prospect of a leadership challenge on monday by angela eagle the former shadow business secretary who is in favour of renewing trident speaking at a nato summit in warsaw poland cameron said today i can announce we will hold a parliamentary vote on 18 july to confirm members of parliaments support for the renewal of four nuclear submarines capable of providing aroundtheclock cover the nuclear deterrent remains essential in my view not just to britains security but as our allies have acknowledged here today the overall security of the nato alliance while britain may be leaving the eu we are not withdrawing from the world nor are we turning our back on europe or european security asked about the timing cameron denied that he was holding it now to cause maximum pain to labour he stressed that holding the vote was a conservative election manifesto pledge that the whole party could agree on we need to get on with that we need certainty about it so investment decisions can go ahead he said so i think it makes sense to hold this vote to hold this vote now to put it beyond doubt so our military planners and investors can get on the investment that is needed thats the reason for holding the vote obviously the whole conservative party supports it we stood on that manifesto so i dont think it would in any way get caught up in the leadership election labours policy has in recent years been in favour of renewing trident as confirmed by its party conference however that stance was put under review by corbyn who appointed emily thornberry who was the shadow defence secretary and is now the shadow foreign secretary to look into the policy this has led the labour leadership to argue it no longer has a protrident position which may mean it allows a free vote on 18 july much of corbyns new shadow cabinet including the shadow defence secretary clive lewis are thought to be against trident but many others in the parliamentary party are in favour reports on friday suggested labours defence review would ultimately leave open the option of retaining the uks nuclear deterrent despite corbyns support for unilateral disarmament bbc newsnight said the review is expected to set five tests for the uks continued status as a nuclear power including whether it makes a demonstrable contribution to the defence of the country and if it represents value for money corbyn told sky news on saturday we are having a look at all the issues surrounding it i believe security in the world is achieved through peace through democracy through justice through human rights i do not believe that nuclear weapons actually enhance security i support the nuclear nonproliferation treaty  which we are signed up to  which is trying to bring together collective disarmament those are the views that i will be putting forward more news topics trident defence policy
