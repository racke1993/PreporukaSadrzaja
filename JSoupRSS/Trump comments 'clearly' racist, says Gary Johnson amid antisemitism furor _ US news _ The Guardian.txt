consider firing government employees who wear hijabs related hillary clintons potential vicepresidents defend her over emails he has said 100 things that would disqualify anyone else from running for president but it doesnt seem to affect him johnson told cnns state of the union the stuff hes saying is just incendiary its racist earlier this week a new hampshire woman asked trump at one of his rallies whether as president he would replace transportation security administration workers who wear heebeejabbies  apparently a reference to muslim headscarves called hijabs we are looking at that trump replied were looking at a lot of things at the same rally trump pointed to a plane flying overhead and declared that could be a mexican plane up there theyre getting ready to attack on saturday trump posted online an image of the presumptive democratic nominee hillary clinton superimposed over a pile of cash and a sixpointed star carrying the text most corrupt candidate ever he was quickly accused of antisemitism for the image and his use of the phrase america first which the antidefamation league has urged him not to use because of its history with nazi sympathizers in the 1930s the news site mic traced the image to a white supremacist message board where on sunday commenters celebrated the death of elie wiesel a holocaust survivor and nobel peace laureate trump or his campaign deleted the tweet after several hours and posted a new image featuring a circle instead of a star his campaign did not respond to a request for comment corey lewandowski the businessmans former campaign manager said on sunday the image was not important the bottom line is you can read into things that are not there he told cnn which hired him as a commentator a few days after he was fired two weeks ago you know this is a simple star lewandowski said the star was the same star that sheriffs departments all over the place use to represent law enforcement in fact the star lacked the circles on its points that such badges typically have the bottom line lewandowski said of the accusations is this is political correctness run amok sorry your browser is unable to play this video
