city no private company had ever been allowed to lay cable under brugess cobbled lanes photograph richard sellerssportsphoto ltdallstar jennifer rankin in bruges friday 8 july 2016 1556bst last

fantasies a beer pipeline that could funnel the staple drink of belgium beneath the cobbled streets and gothic houses of bruges everyone always thought its a dream its a joke it is something that is not realisable at all said xavier vanneste director and heir to de halve maan brugess only continuously working old brewery now though the dream is about to become reality belgiums first major beer pipeline will start pumping beneath bruges from september if all goes to plan enough beer to fill 12000 bottles an hour will slosh down the twomile underground pipeline from de halve maan half moon in the city centre to an outoftown bottling plant vanneste was inspired when he saw workmen laying broadband cables outside his house and on the spur of the moment dashed into the street when i started talking to those guys he said i realised it was possible it was feasible tunnel laying broadband or gas is one thing a beer pipeline is something else no private company had ever been allowed to lay cable under the citys cobbled lanes and around the renowned medieval buildings that have secured brugess place on the unesco world heritage list and at first city officials were dubious my first reaction was oh my god what are they thinking said the mayor of bruges renaat landuyt but it did not take long to win him round he said when he realised the pipeline would sharply reduce the number of beer tankers driving in and out of the city facebook twitter pinterest the bruges underground photograph alamy stock photo he sees the pipeline as a way to preserve a working brewery in the historic centre and prevent bruges from turning into a museum if we dont make sure that people can work in the city centre we will kill the city centre he said brewing on the de halve maan site was first recorded in 1564 vannestes ancestor took over the brewery in 1856 where he made a hazy beer that tastes a little sour before the second world war bruges city centre was home to at least 30 working breweries at that time beer supplies were delivered by horse and cart to peoples homes and tourists had not yet discovered the citys flemish old masters and winding canals de halve maan is the last survivor of that vanished world although one venerable old brewer recently reopened after a gap of 60 years today beer is no longer brewed in twometre deep open vats that have to be scrubbed out with hand cloths and brooms instead water barley yeast and hops are mixed in four stateoftheart steel kettles overlooked by st arnold the patron saint of brewing several floors up visitors can stand under the redbrick brewery chimney with the citys rooftops spread at their feet and the air rich with the tealike malty aroma of brewing beer some financial experts advised vanneste to close the city brewery  a charming warren of rooms dating back to the 16th century  and move operations to the bland industrial estate housing the bottling plant but that would have meant de halve maan could no longer say its beer was made in bruges for me unesco heritage is not only about bricks and material things but having a living brewery here vanneste says that is a part of the immaterial heritage bruges is full of tourist traps he continues you have chocolate that is not made here or even in belgium we want to brew every single litre here  right where it has been brewed for so many centuries just as trappist beer is brewed in the abbey or champagne is brewed in the champagne area so he hired tunnelling experts from the oil and gas industry and belgiums top professor in malting and brewing laying the pipeline was done using computerguided drills to minimise street digging that pleased city planners but increased costs facebook twitter pinterest de halve maan brewery photograph alamy stock photo related the beer mile  like the olympics but with boozing despite initial doubts from city councillors the beer pipeline has become an urban hit sparking endless jokes about illegal tapping points and secret home drilling some 300000 of the 4m 34m budget was raised through crowdfunding the most expensive gold membership costs 7500 and allows the buyer a bottle of blonde brugse zot the bruges fool beer every day for life and 18 personalised glasses local business owners who have long seen beer tankers struggling to turn around on narrow lanes are supportive gavin vandenbroucke is manager of the new walnut a familyrun brasserie decked out in bunting coloured the red black and gold of the national flag to celebrate that other source of belgian pride the football team he describes the beer pipeline as very special it is big publicity for bruges for the brewery and for belgian beers he said the opening will be welcome as his takings are sharply down since the paris attacks and then the bombings in brussels put belgium on high alert over the street marc souris who owns the fascino hat shop was sceptical that traffic would decrease pointing out that the ingredients for making beer still had to be delivered to the brewery but the project was a great and unique one that was bound to bring more tourists to the city around 100000 people visit the brewery each year we get a little slice of that cake he said his turnover too is down  by a third on last year march was a disaster because of the brussels attacks  and june is too quiet he said a series of strikes on belgian railways last month did not help either it should be packed now related the aggressive outrageous infuriating and ingenious rise of brewdog  jon henley nicole stael who sells postcards snow globes and souvenir plates said that in the 40 years she had owned her gift shop business had not been so bad fear of the unknown was keeping people away she thought the threat is not in one place and people are no longer sure where is safe she said across the square outside the brewery horses and carriages clip clop down the lane de halve maan is in the final weeks of testing the beer pipeline four separate polyethylene tubes that look like ordinary drainpipes the brewer does not think the pipeline will pay back in less than 20 years but it appears to be a shrewd commercial move de halve maan has seen doubledigit growth for its beers for more than a decade and now exports to 30 countries including the us and china the bruges brewer is riding a wave of interest in traditional belgian beers as drinkers turn against bland watery lagers and look for flavour although belgians are drinking less beer than they used to they are getting choosier beer drinkers are opting for trappist and abbey brews ales and blonde beers rather than midpriced lagers according to the latest market research by euromonitor people are also rediscovering family brewers partly driven by the craze for craft beers a lot of people love craft beers they are very hoppy and very strong but they are a little bit too much in flavour at the moment said marc stroobandt a master beer sommelier the family breweries have been doing it for years and have found the right balance of flavour and drinkability he thinks the pipeline will help de halve maan preserve its authenticity and provenance adding i am so surprised they got authorisation to do it more features topics belgium europe beer food  drink share on facebook share on twitter share via email share on linkedin share on
