how the uk went to war in iraq saturday 9 july 2016 0800bst share on facebook share on twitter share via email share on linkedin share on google share on whatsapp share on messenger tuesday 2 april 2002 was a warm spring day the first after the easter weekend the country was coming to terms with the death of the queen mother a young singer called gareth gates had shot to no 1 and admiral lord boyce chief of the defence staff was heading to buckinghamshire for a meeting with the prime minister at chequers a submariner in his early career colleagues thought boyce rather prickly a trait cabinet minister clare short attributed to the long periods he had spent underwater certainly his summons to see tony blair seemed to have left him a little nonplussed british forces were already deployed in afghanistan which was his priority and though he had heard talk in the press and around whitehall about a shift in interest towards iraq he wasnt one for gossip or small talk related tony blair with you whatever pledge was not commitment to war blair however wanted to chat about saddam hussein i guess my presence at chequers on that particular occasion was simply  if there were questions coming up about what could be done militarily what was our capability should we be asked to do something boyce explained to the chilcot inquiry if there had been a significant hardening of thinking in downing street boyce appeared to have left chequers none the wiser as far as he was concerned attacking iraq just wasnt on the cards there was no discussion on the detail of military action or military options he said of course iraq wasnt off our plot entirely it was something which the mod was keeping a watching eye on if you like at the meeting  no particular preparations were made it was a scoping opportunity  we were certainly not doing any thinking about any sort of military adventure the meeting was rather casual  and very blairish others in the room included sir richard dearlove the head of mi6 and sir john scarlett head of the joint intelligence committee jic but the cabinet secretary lord wilson hadnt known it had taken place the foreign and defence secretaries werent there either  and no minutes were taken the discussion it seemed had been organised to help blair prepare his thoughts for an important trip to the us at the end of the week facebook twitter pinterest president bush and first lady laura bush greet british prime minister tony blair on his arrival at the bush ranch in crawford texas saturday april 5 2002 photograph susan walshap what exactly happened on 6 and 7 april in crawford texas between the us president george w bush and the man who was determined to be his best friend not even chilcots 26mword report has been able to entirely unravel but if there was one event that changed the conversation about iraq it was this because while blair insisted no deal was done and no hands shaken on military action chilcots report describes how the mood changed thereafter and how the whitehall machine at different speeds in different departments reacting to different voices began to hum the tempo changed and little wonder we now know that boyce was not fully in the loop he had not been told that months earlier in december 2001 there had been quite substantive exchanges between no 10 and the white house about the possibility of military action against iraq they werent ones which we were apprised of boyce told chilcot nor would he have known that in the days before crawford colin powell the us secretary of state had sent a secret memo to bush saying that blair will be with us should military operations be necessary in iraq he is convinced the threat is real  and success against saddam will yield more regional success in the weeks after crawford there were more obvious indications that iraq was about to become britains problem richard armitage the us deputy secretary of state told sir david manning blairs foreign policy adviser that the us and the uk were already discussing the idea of britain sending a 20000strong armoured division to iraq this was news to manning  and he was miffed in a terse letter sent on 21 may the ministry of defence was ordered to find out who was saying what to whom seeing as no options have yet been presented to ministers ten days later the mod had got nowhere in a return letter a senior officer concluded the talk was just speculation and the americans must have misinterpreted what they had been told it did not matter whether through accident or design chilcot noted that by midmay the perception the uk might provide an armoured division for military operations had already gained currency in the us the idea had got into the american bloodstream though boyce doesnt appear to have been privy to blairs thinking the military had reason to be getting twitchy we now know that shortly after crawford the mod set up a small informal working group under lt gen sir anthony pigott to brainstorm the possible options for and repercussions of british involvement in a military effort pigott told chilcot that he was trying to prevent the uk setting off on an off the cuff  lets go and do that campaign we need to do some scoping work  what could we be dealing with here what might be the big issues but as work began it became abundantly clear to senior military officials that the americans had already decided to pursue regime change and that the push could come before the end of the year the americans it seemed were determined to remove saddam and they had also assumed for reasons that were not entirely clear to military chiefs that britain would be alongside them geoff hoon the defence secretary was worried about what he was hearing from his officials and in early june sought guidance from blair ahead of a meeting with his opposite number donald rumsfeld facebook twitter pinterest defence secretary donald rumsfeld and defence secretary geoff hoon

discuss the detail and timescales of a potential uk military contribution to a usled coalition it could send a misleading signal that we have decided to support a specific line of military action equally if we are not clear with the us at this stage about our military constraints we face the danger of our not being able to bring anything meaningful to the table at the right time and the consequent loss of influence that would bring hoon wanted the americans to know that the british needed plenty of warning in order to be able to contribute to military action but blair wasnt happy that will send a wobbly message he wrote as the military tried to reconcile the mixed signals from whitehall and washington the us formally invited the british to join a military planning team based at central command in tampa florida related cameron really was the true heir to blair both were totally reckless  jonathan freedland boyce said this early military planning was taking place in a political void and he says he stressed to the americans that joining the team should not imply a political commitment to contribute to an actual operation but while he said he kept reiterating this to his american counterparts  i cant remember how many times i must have said  that our policy was not regime change  they seemed to know better the reaction of the americans was always yes i hear what you say but come the day we know you will be there he told chilcot elsewhere in whitehall there were others attempting to read the runes from downing street over exactly what was going on and what britain was being drawn into the attorney general peter goldsmith was one he had been watching events unfold and didnt like what he was seeing it irritated him when he heard ministers talking loosely about whether there was a clear basis for military action against iraq and he wanted the americans to know that whatever conclusions they had drawn about the use of force he did not share them he had steeled himself to report this to william taft iv legal adviser to the department of state at a meeting on 22 may but in the end the two men somehow avoided the subject and just chatted lord goldsmith evidently thought it was more important to inform the prime minister of his misgivings even though his advice was unsolicited and not terribly welcome by downing street knowing that blair was due to meet bush again at the end of july goldsmith set about drawing up legal advice which he presented to the prime minister on 23 july he told blair that to his mind the americans were plain wrong to think they could take military action against iraq to remove saddam without going back to the un i had looked at whether there was a selfdefence argument and didnt believe there was that was because i didnt see any evidence of an imminent threat and you need an imminent threat he told chilcot i didnt want there to be any doubt the legalities however were not going to upset the special increasingly intimate relationship between blair and bush as the chilcot report has now shown any concerns about the legality of a conflict had not prevented blair from offering unwavering support to the president as set out in that now notorious memo dated 28 july i will be with you whatever blair wrote goldsmith did not see the prime minister again for three months but in the meantime he decided he needed to know more about the threat posed by saddam in case this changed his thinking he asked for a briefing from the man who would know  scarlett facebook twitter pinterest sir john scarlett chairman of the joint intelligence committee photograph martin godwin for the guardian scarlett though was a busy man who was having difficulties of his own the jic had already compiled one report on iraq in may 2001 and had undertaken another assessment in march 2002 which had been drawn up ahead of blairs trip to crawford it had reached many of the same conclusions iraq was assessed to retain some stocks of chemical weapons but there were no details on locations or quantities it was stated that there was clear evidence of continuing biological warfare activity  and intelligence about the likelihood of mobile production laboratories was being taken seriously but the chilcot inquiry heard that intelligence gathered on iraq was far from an exact science it needed to be treated with great care as sir mark allen former head of mi6s counterintelligence branch and one of its more maverick voices was keen to stress actually our knowledge of iraq was very very superficial he told chilcot we were small animals in a dark wood with the wind getting up and changing direction the whole time these were very very difficult days scarlett knew this all too well and had been working on the basis that the march analysis could be filleted for publication instead this dossier was put in cold storage until the autumn when things suddenly gathered pace i suppose the person who opened the freezer was the prime minister scarlett told chilcot he made a public announcement that the government assessment of iraqs weapons of mass destruction capabilities would be published in the coming weeks the pressure was on but mi6 known formally as the secret intelligence service appeared to have new and potentially important information that was passed to the prime minister on 12 september a new source had provided intelligence that appeared to support claims that iraq had continued to produce chemical and biological agents and had military plans for the use of chemical and biological weapons this was used by scarlett to help underpin key judgments in the governments dossier on iraqs weapons of mass destruction wmd which was published to much fanfare and a fair degree of ridicule on 24 september though too late to be included in the document mi6 privately disseminated a second report from the same sourcing chain which stated vx sarin and soman toxic chemicals had been produced by iraq and had been loaded into a variety of containers including linked hollow glass spheres the source said there had been accelerated production of substances for several years but within weeks senior officers at mi6s hq in vauxhall central london were beginning to sweat doubts had begun to emerge about the reliability of this information to the layman the details the source had provided sounded like something from a hollywood movie and thats because they were more precisely they had come from a film called the rock starring nicolas cage and sean connery as chilcot noted in early october questions were raised with sis about the mention of glass containers it was pointed out that glass containers were not typically used in chemical munitions and that a popular movie the rock had inaccurately depicted nerve agents being carried in glass beads or spheres sis began to realise it had been duped and eventually concluded the source had been lying but remarkably it decided not to tell anyone who might need to know  such as the prime minister another intelligence source that had been heavily relied upon by the jic was codenamed curve ball but this information also had health warnings for a start it had not come to british intelligence directly  it had been channelled through the german spy agencies and as chilcot reported sis didnt get to meet curve ball until much later and when it did agents didnt like the look of him they were forced to conclude the information he provided  specifically that iraq had developed mobile facilities for the production of biological agent  was wholly unreliable asked by chilcot to summarise the unpalatable and chastening lessons that mi6 had had to learn a senior officer told him its not so much a lesson its an observation that we based a lot on not enough while mi6 kept quiet about the doubts over the authenticity of some of the intelligence the military and goldsmith were simultaneously grappling with different if intertwined problems of their own having had a personal briefing from scarlett the attorney general remained unconvinced about the threat posed by saddam and hadnt changed his mind about needing to go back to the un to seek authority for military action but a new resolution that was being proposed did not go far enough as far as he was concerned goldsmith met blair on 22 october to outline his concerns that resolution 1441  which stated that iraq was in material breach of its un obligations  still did not provide a sound basis for military action he gave the same gloomy prognosis to the foreign secretary jack straw on 7 november the day before the resolution was passed my provisional view was that there wasnt enough there goldsmith told chilcot as i have consistently said from the legal point of view it would have been safer to have had a second resolution because it would have put the matter beyond doubt nobody could have then challenged the legality goldsmith was also angered by chinese whispers across whitehall that appeared to be putting a much more positive gloss on his advice as far as he was concerned even with resolution 1441 everything would not be all right on the night he told chilcot that the gossip appeared to be coming from the undergrowth if i can say beneath ministers sometimes people who are least involved in issues pick up things and they then come out that is just the way government seems to work facebook twitter pinterest lord goldsmith arrives at number 10 photograph martin argles for the guardian as goldsmith told downing street what it didnt want to hear so the mod was still seeking clarity from no 10 about the scale of britains potential military commitment to any usled invasion declassified papers show hoon presented the prime minister with a uk military options paper on 15 october  and said that an urgent decision had to be taken we need to decide this week the paper began us military planning for an operation in iraq is gathering pace three basic packages were outlined with the third being the most ambitious it included more than 300 tanks and armoured vehicles and 28000 personnel it would be a major element of the northern line of attack which the us now judge as essential a memo dated 31 october sets out how blair offered support for the more expensive and risky third option and concluded that we should now tell the us  for planning purposes of all the scenarios this seemed to be the one favoured by the mod if the uk were to attack iraq coming in from the north had clear advantages the area was more stable than the south and contained many of the oil fields that needed to be protected and secured related chilcot fails the key test on blairs duplicity he pulls his punches  chris ames but there was a problem turkey britain needed to use it as a base in early discussions with his opposite number in ankara boyce thought the turks would allow the british to pitch camp certainly when i spoke to the chief of the turkish general staff gen hilmi ozkuk in the very early days there didnt appear  well he didnt seem to think it would be a particular problem even after the americans warned the mod that we were probably pushing against a closed door boyce held out hope i was talking to ozkuk and he was giving me sort of not exactly bright green lights but certainly not saying dont bother to darken my door again facebook twitter pinterest chief of defence staff admiral sir michael boyce leaves downing street february 6 2003 photograph toby melvillereuters the red light came at the turn of the year which stopped british planning for an invasion from the north so at the start of 2003 the situation looked bleak the british military was scrabbling to find a new role the attorney general was warning there was no basis for the use of force and some of the intelligence that had been used to support claims of saddams military capabilities was falling apart yet within weeks uk forces would invade never an organisation to shirk a challenge boyce and the other chiefs of staff assured blair in early january that the uk still had enough time to prepare for an invasion from the south through kuwait but with time running out he conceded there was inevitably going to be some equipment shortfall  though none which were being advised as showstoppers or of critical importance to mission accomplishment the mod was also concerned about what was happening with postwar planning and was attempting to seek assurances from the americans that they had a robust blueprint  because britain didnt have one a memo dated 16 january 2003 said the prime minister agrees  that much greater clarity about the us intentions is required boyce also warned blair he was still worried about the legalities i made it clear to the prime minister in january 2003 that i would require an assurance of the legal base of the conflict this was reiterated more than once in the following weeks the prime minister however was to get a break from an unlikely source the attorney general had given blair his draft advice on the legality of any conflict on 14 january  and it was much the same as months before but over the coming weeks goldsmith had an unexpected and quite sudden change of heart the process began on 23 january when he had a private meeting with sir jeremy greenstock britains ambassador to the un who had evidently been sent to soften him up sir jeremy had made some good points and he had made some headway with me but frankly there was still work for me to do and he hadnt got me there if you like yet goldsmith told chilcot on 10 february the attorney general flew to washington and had a number of meetings with top legal advisers who had all concluded that the use of force did not require a further un resolution the us were convincing goldsmith admitted they told him that even the french didnt think a new resolution was required  so why did he if it wasnt quite an epiphany goldsmith nonetheless changed tack he told the inquiry that he had asked himself which side of the argument would you prefer to be on and i took the view i would prefer to be on the side of the argument that said a second resolution wasnt necessary when he flew home he informed downing street though he did not give his advice in writing it was the green light blair had doubtless been praying for in his evidence to the inquiry hans blix head of the uns weapons inspectors said that by the end of february with almost 250000 coalition forces on the border of iraq the momentum for war was almost unstoppable as i have said sometimes perhaps a little roughly the uk remained a prisoner on that train if downing street didnt quite see it that way wilson the cabinet secretary admitted to chilcot that everything was done at a rush  it did make it a tightrun thing perhaps inevitably perhaps deliberately certain things  and certain people  got overlooked one of them was clare short secretary of state at the department for international development she had expected to be involved in discussions about the aftermath of any conflict but had been kept out of any conversations until the last moment related blair misled the country over iraq something similar could happen again  clare short suddenly there is a flurry of correspondence she told chilcot there is all of this keep clare and dfid out of it and then just at the last minute they are suddenly writing letters saying we must make preparations and im saying to our military youre going to have to feed people and they suddenly in the last week they ordered food i mean it was mad but they did it and they wanted to get closer to us suddenly at the last minute and we didnt sulk the situation was too serious she added but the chaos had its consequences i think the british military should have said to blair we are not ready i think that was their duty and they failed in that duty chilcot revealed that by the time the war started nobody in government appeared to have overall responsibility for postwar planning and nobody in the military was taking responsibility for the shortfalls in vital equipment in one of chilcots coldest and most damning conclusions he said when mr blair set out the uks vision for the future of iraq in the house of commons on 18 march 2003 no assessment had been made of whether that vision was achievable no agreement had been reached with the us on a workable postconflict plan un authorisation had not yet been secured and there was no decision on the uns role in postconflict iraq a conflict that began in haste and endures today did not have to start when it did nor in the way it did chilcot said the evidence is there for all to see it is an account of an intervention which went badly wrong with consequences to
