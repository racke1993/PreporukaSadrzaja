family who was the creepy man in the family photo as a child sarah lippett would stare at the really weird and creepy man in the photo at the top of the stairs in her grandmothers house and wonder who he was years later letters from nan began to arrive  along with the answers sarah lippett  i think nan lost that spark when stan died photograph nik vestberg paula cocozza saturday 9 july 2016 0615bst share on facebook share on twitter share via email share on linkedin share on google share on whatsapp share on messenger every saturday as a child when sarah lippett visited her grandmothers house she was transfixed by the objects inside they loomed before her seeming to suggest questions that neither they  nor her grandmother  wanted to answer the window sills were jammed with ornaments id sit there and work them like you do when youre a kid sarah says waggling her hands as if each again held a porcelain figurine paintings crowded the walls and she had the impression that the family knew the artist but the biggest mystery was a photograph at the top of the stairs i can see it now there was nan with a man but what was he doing there he was really weird and creepy she was nan and she lived on her own i never even thought there was a granddad missing sarah says she sits on the sofa in her flat in east london an old photograph album across her lap on the other side i had a nanny and grandad but nan was  well she was just nan a woman who opened the door with arms full of cuddles and the scent of freshly baked cakes but who steadfastly refused to talk about herself sarah had only one clue that grief lay behind the silence i used to catch my mum occasionally crying at christmas because thats when she missed her dad the most as the years passed sarah now 31 came to understand that the man in the photograph was stan her nans late husband who was never mentioned but by then the hole in the family tree had created for her a kind of personal uncertainty she had to find out more the result is stan and nan a graphic memoir that charts sarahs process of discovery starting with a sketch of her childhood self  an eager listener in spectacles  visiting her nan at home in tettenhall wolverhampton while her nan talks their mugs of tea enlarge and shrink in the squares of the novel as the emotion intensifies and the details of stans life unfold tantalisingly the bottom edge of two paintings which sarah would later find out were stans pictures of stratford  so detailed i could sort of place myself in the street  are just visible on the wall the frames hovering outside the frame of sarahs drawing did i ever tell you your grandad was the youngest of seven nan asks and the story begins but in reality of course it didnt happen like that by 2011 when sarah became desperate to learn about her late grandfather she was at art school too far away to visit she and her nan had always stayed in touch by letter  as regularly as i sent them shed send them faster  and so now sarah began to write i thought ill drop it in and see if she responds i just said id love to know more about grandad she was unsure how her nan would meet a direct request for information but before long she had the answer a letter written in slanting lines on a4 in which she told me pretty much the whole story facebook twitter pinterest sarah lippetts grandparents stan and joyce whose relationship features in stan and nan soon a second letter arrived stans life told in vignettes he enjoyed a bet on the horses with his friend ernest he sacrificed a place at art school after an accident curtailed his fathers working life he courted sarahs nan despite her parents disapproval of his workingclass upbringing they met because each day she walked past the fire station where he worked en route to her own office you have probably seen some of his pictures scattered around the house nan wrote there are two of stratford in the dining room  i love them all the letters contained no single revelation no great family catastrophe hid between the lines what really shocked sarah was how heavily laden the thin sheets of pale blue paper were with love and mourning you know when you read something and you can visualise the way if someone was telling you they would look sarah asks when someone is talking about someone they love and theres a spark in their eyes and telling you about them just brings that person to life it was really moving and i hadnt had that from my nan ever i think she lost that spark when he died thats what the letters brought out for me this love carried through sarah wrote again asking for more details this time a letter came back with the briefest of answers and then she wrote  and obviously it was too much for her  because she wrote this is the last letter im going to send to you about your granddad and she underlined it last sarah began to draw and on her next visit to nan now 92 and ill at home she took sketches including one of stan nan laughed but the drawing was difficult nothing was working sarah says she had found out about stan but a new mystery bloomed in its place now sarah wondered why she knew so little of nans life when i got older i wondered why didnt nan remarry why didnt she meet anyone else why didnt she go out and do anything on visits nan always quizzed sarah about life  tell me what youre doing tell me everything  but revealed nothing of her own my nan left me this in her will sarah says bobbing out of the room she returns with an ornament a small porcelain girl nan had it because she thought it looked like me when i was little i always had my thumb in my mouth and a little blanket i carried around she places the ornament beside her on the sofa in the novel sarah transforms silence into strength events of magnitude are conveyed with brutal wordless economy so that nans demise comes quickly falling fallen within two squares sarahs eyes are shiny as we turn the pages nan died in 2013 shortly before her 95th birthday facebook twitter pinterest a page from stan and nan sarah lippetts graphic novel showing the couples younger life photograph sarah lippett it is heartbreaking for sarah that she didnt live long enough to see all the drawings of stan to read the finished story but then the book would be a very different thing because it was at the funeral that sarah really began to understand her grandmother i met people who could help me piece together all the bits that she had left empty for me she even met piggy one of nans old schoolfriends new letters hit sarahs mat the envelopes addressed in a hand heartbreakingly similar to nans facebook twitter pinterest an illustration from stan and nan sarah lippetts graphic novel photograph courtesy sarah lippett i think i accepted them more the decisions that she made with her life why she didnt want to talk it was just too painful stan was only 52 when he returned early from work feeling off colour within a few hours he lay dead on the bed she lost so many years with him sarah says laying a hand on a sketch she made from a photograph of her grandparents together he is kneedeep in the sea giving nan a piggyback i dont think ive ever seen her laugh that much sarah says shes just totally  loose lost in that moment one of the books most moving sequences shows sarah at her nans hospital bedside stripped of colour and words square after square shows her clutching grasping covering stroking her nans hand i was talking to her but i dont know if she could hear me so feeling her hand and feeling the warmth of her hand and having that contact  she trails off i held her hand and just talked to her in my head there are so many pictures of these last moments of touch as if the pencil itself cannot bear to let go sarah says she loved being able to make things happen for her nan in the book that didnt happen in life stans old hankering to open a cafe where he could sell his paintings while nan baked her cakes is rendered here in a way that gives life to the dream when sarah showed elements of this work in her graduation show at the royal college of art she felt she had got stan into art school at last a life has been coloured in even stans pictures of stratford are blank canvases no more by the end of the book sarah has sketched inside the frames maybe she says its time to hang one on her own wall
