bike blog why wont tv show more womens cycling the two most important bike races in the world are on right now but you can only watch the tour de france boys on telly meanwhile fans of the giro rosa must check twitter to follow the girls helen pidd talks to tv networks  and cycling commentator ned boulting to find out why anyone wanting to follow lizzie armitsteads progress in the giro rosa back at home in britain had to rely on social media with no live coverage or even daily highlights show photograph scott mitchellteamskycom via getty images helen pidd saturday 9 july 2016 0752bst last

for cycling fans three glorious weeks of the tour de france to gorge on provided you can wrestle the remote from any wimbledon watchers in your life yet while it is possible to watch mark cavendishs renaissance live on both eurosport and itv4 anyone wanting to follow the giro rosa has to make do with crumbs posted on social media the giro rosa is the longest stage race in womens cycling with nine tappe in italys highest most beautiful mountains with the olympic road race course looking particularly hilly this august the womens giro offers the perfect chance to assess who is in with the best chance of a medal in rio if only you could actually watch it without getting on a plane to italy every evening i catchup with the tour highlights on itv4 and look at various twitter feeds to piece together what happened in the giro rosa on friday i found out that evelyn stevens of the usa won the individual time trial her third stage win of the 2016 edition id been wondering how lizzie armitstead had been getting on it was only after some googling i found out our homegrown world champion pulled out after feeling poorly apparently the italians show giro highlights each night but no english language broadcaster seems to want to follow suit its a huge problem for womens cycling as us cyclist mara abbott explained to me last week without tv coverage the sponsors arent interested without sponsors willing to invest decent money riders dont get paid properly and like abbott end up working on civvy street to make ends meet i couldnt believe it when she told me she worked at a farmers market to pay her mortgage this winter despite winning the giro rosa twice tv is everything said ned boulting who has taken over commentary duties alongside retired pro david millar on itv4s tour de france coverage this year thats not unique to womens racing though its a universal truth in a sport that prints no tickets and operates no turnstiles i asked him if he would like to see at least five minutes of giro rosa highlights incorporated into the nightly tdf highlights show no he said id like to see an hour long highlights programme from the giro rosa i think that wedging it into a tour de france show would be a difficult fit and tokenistic that prospect may be distant but its not inconceivable race organisers need to be the motor behind this growth invest in good tv production not cheap and offer the broadcast up to terrestrial channels for free that is how the tour of britain and then the womens tour became big robust established races only that way can you attract sponsors to the sport its a risk but its the only way of changing the stalemate broadcasters with the possible exception of the bbc have no remit other than to return rewarding ratings to their shareholders and advertisers they are not tasked with growing the sport their influence can change the game for sure but its not their responsibility boulting has no time for those who suggest womens cycling is somehow less exciting given the slower average speeds good racing is good racing that much crosses over he said so why wont itv show the giro rosa we dont have the tv rights said a spokesman but have you bid for them i asked he didnt know but thought not they are planning to show two hours live footage of la course running concurrently with the final day of the tour de france on itv4 though and have the rights to show live coverage of the womens tour de yorkshire 2017 as well as highlights of the womens tour of britain and the tour series additionally itv4 will run a feature on womens cycling on the tour de france rest day july 19 according to morgane gaultier womens cycling coordinator at the uci cyclings global governing body if itv wanted to buy the highlights they could i think there is no problem at all and the race organiser will be happy to have his race broadcast all around the world she said eurosport said it didnt show the womens race because the live rights are not available and they arent interested in just buying a highlights package womens sport and cycling are central to eurosports dna said a spokesman unfortunately the giro is not currently available for live broadcast however in the uk we currently showcase five races which are produced for live coverage tour of flanders la course by le tour ride london gp plouay bretagne classic madrid challenge by la vuelta in addition to coverage of the womens events at the british national championships and the uci track european championships and world championships eurosport also broadcasts a monthly magazine voxwomen which is 100 dedicated to womens cycling i asked brian cookson the ucis lancastrian president what he was doing to get more womens cycling on telly and he put gaultier in touch she talked of how 2016 has seen the introduction of the uci womens worldtour uciwwt which has 35 days of racing compared with 10 days in the previous uci womens world cup one of the criteria weve had for races to be included in the uciwwt is the commitment of organisers to broadcast the event for the 2016 season 10 of the 17 uciwwt events have live coverage that live coverage is sometimes limited only to their home country but its still a step forwards said gaultier we do wish things could develop more quickly but there are some obstacles to more rapid development one is purely financial as the costs of high quality tv production for cycling road races are very high compared to many other sports event organisers have limits on what they can invest in this and while the uci has itself made a significant contribution in our resources as well as finance we have competing demands on our budget too another is broadcast given competition to get scheduled even if you have the product again while we have put a very considerable amount of time and effort into this we are not ourselves the broadcast rights owner  those rights are owned by the event organisers in the case of the giro rosa this year there are daily highlights on italian tv rai but live streamingbroadcast has not been possible topics tour de france cycling tour de france 2016 women share on facebook share
