without essentials and rely on their own elderly parents because of the unfair way changes to the state pension age have been made according to labours frank field the veteran mp says that many women born in the 1950s have been grotesquely disadvantaged by the governments handling and communication of the changes he is one of a number of highprofile figures to speak out about pension age increases that some women have said will leave them as much as 40000 out of pocket for decades the state pension age spa for women was 60 an increase to 65 phased in between 2010 and 2020 was included in the pensions act 1995 but five years ago the coalition government pushed through a speeding up of the process the spa for women is instead increasing to 65 between april 2016 and november 2018 then 66 by october 2020 many women say they had always expected to receive their pension at 60 then discovered their spa had increased by perhaps four five or even six years amazingly the government did not write to any woman affected by the rise in the pension ages for nearly 14 years after the law was passed in 1995 the result is that hundreds of thousands of women say they didnt have enough time to make alternative plans field says he has received many letters from women who have been affected here are some of their testimonies  i was born in 1954 i received no prior notification from dwp i am in the process of having to sell my family home to supplement the shortfall which works out at about 40000 money i feel has been stolen from me had i received my state pension at 60 i would not have had to sell my family home where i raised my daughters  i cannot begin to tell you the deep problems i face because the government failed to give me any notice about my pension deferment i will have to sell my home because my situation is untenable to sustain for a further fourandahalf years and as i can no longer get a mortgage i have been ill and continue to suffer from periods of stressrelated illnesses  i was born in december 1955 am single and did not receive a dwp letter until 2013 advising me i would retire at 66 this gave me only two years notice of a sixyear rise at present i am forced to rely on my 80yearold retired mum to help with the purchase of meals or clothes as i am utilising dwindling savings to pay bills this is an intolerable burden placed on older women and i fear i will not be able to carry on should anything happen to my mum  i was never informed i could not retire until i was 66  i have nothing to look forward to after working all these years but poverty i have applied for more than 60 jobs since being made redundant but who wants to employ a 61yearold nurse who has arthritis in her knees and is unable to lift patients  when i was 52 i gave up fulltime work with the idea of doing contract work for six months a year i had worked out that i could afford to do this until i had my pension paid at age 60 so now i am 61 its fourandahalf years until i get a pension and i have sold my house with the intention of buying a smaller cheaper property in a different town so that i have some money to live on leaving my son daughter grandchild elderly parents and two sisters in the town where i currently live as from june i shall be officially homeless and am currently living in my partners campervan on a campsite  i was born in january 1954  i have struggled for so long alone that i finally broke down a couple of nights ago  im almost losing the will to live when everything is such a battle i cant wait another three years for my pension campaigners from the waspi group women against state pension inequality staged a demonstration outside parliament on 29 june field chairs the commons work and pensions select committee which has been looking into this issue he has written to work and pensions secretary stephen crabb to say the government must at the very least offer this group the option of taking their state pension early at a reduced rate in may crabb told mps that it would be impossible to unwind changes dating back more than 20 years meanwhile in january the department for work and pensions said those affected by faster equalisation would reach state pension age after the introduction of the new state pension which would be more generous for many women more news topics state pensions retirement planning pensions
