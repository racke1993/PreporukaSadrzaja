all means make your own if you are starting with firm icecream let it sit at room temperature until its soft enough to spoon into the moulds the sorbet is set by whisking it as it sits in the freezer

nochurn raspberry icecream facebook twitter pinterest yotam ottolenghis nochurn raspberry icecream this has the clean fresh flavour of sorbet but the rich smooth depth of icecream its delicious with the puree suggested but its also mighty fine with some white chocolate sauce roast peaches or even just whipped cream its also worth trying it with a few mixed berries macerated in sugar syrup vanilla

off by the stages involved in making these it may look like a lot of work but the joy of an icecream machine which is a must here im afraid is that a lot of that work is done for you dutch process cocoa has a smoother more mellow flavour than natural cocoa its widely available so just check the label  green  blacks cocoa powder is just one brand thats dutched also the biscuits and nuts can be made in advance if that helps with getting organised if you dont fancy making biscuits the icecream is mighty fine on its own makes 12 sandwiches 120g whole almonds skin on 200g plain flour plus extra for dusting 55g cocoa powder dutch process  tsp baking powder salt 100g unsalted butter 160g soft light brown sugar  tsp vanilla extract 60ml whole milk for the icecream 4 egg yolks 100g caster sugar

and set half to one side roll the remaining piece of dough to 3mm thick then cut out discs with an 8cm round cookie cutter arrange these inside a plastic container keeping them apart from each other with baking parchment otherwise theyll stick repeat with the remaining dough reroll any offcuts so that you can make 24 biscuits in total then freeze the discs for at least 15 minutes to bake arrange the discs on two oven trays lined with greaseproof paper and bake for six minutes until firm on the outside but still a little soft in the centre remove the tray from the oven and set aside for five

icecream soften a little spread out the blitzed almonds on a flat plate roll the exposed icecream in the nuts and serve rose and pistachio semifreddo with chocolate sauce facebook twitter pinterest yotam ottolenghis rose and pistachio semifreddo with chocolate sauce youll need a sugar thermometer for this because the temperature of the sugar syrup is crucial for a soft and creamy consistency they cost about a fiver which i rationalise by viewing it as about the same or cheaper than two halflitre tubs of goodquality shopbought icecream you dont have to make the chocolate sauce but it does go fantastically well with the semifreddo serves eight oil to grease 5 cardamom pods 240g double cream 1 tsp goodquality lebanese rose water such as cortas if you cant get that use just  tsp of a supermarket ownbrand 50g shelled pistachio kernels finely blitzed plus another 30g roughly chopped to garnish 2 egg whites 65g 40g runny honey 40g caster sugar 30g liquid glucose salt for the

the clean bowl of an electric mixer with the whisk attachment in place put the honey sugar and glucose in a small saucepan put on a mediumlow heat and stir until the sugar has melted increase the heat to medium bring to a boil and leave to bubble for about two minutes resisting the urge to stir until the sugar thermometer registers 110c immediately begin whisking the egg whites on a high speed until soft peaks form when the syrup reaches 116c remove from the heat and turn down the mixer speed to medium with the machine running slowly and continuously pour the syrup into the egg whites whisking all the time until it is all is incorporated then continue to whip for eight minutes more until the mix is cool fold in the whipped cream until completely mixed through then pour the mixture into the prepared tin and smooth down the top gently tap the tin on the bench to disperse any air bubbles then fold over the greaseproof paper overhang so the semifreddo mix is completely enclosed
