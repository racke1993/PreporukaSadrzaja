 Just look around and you will see by yourself darling  I really dont think anyone cares to tell you truth  But you just said you are vegan i am out  Dont call me darling I have a boyfriend you hypocrite  I dont believe in god whatsoever I am a vegan  Just leave me alone and let me eat my meat  There is no need for that kind of language really  But you dont understand and I dont believe you liar
