Leicester’s success has definite echoes of what we achieved at Nottingham Forest
Just like Brian Clough’s great Nottingham Forest side the new champions refused to let their bubble burst. Now they must test themselves in Europe, writes former Forest player John Robertson

I
can understand why people see similarities between this Leicester City side and the one I played in at Nottingham Forest, and it’s because of what happened to us all those years ago that I was always wary of writing off Claudio Ranieri’s team. I’m probably the same as most people – earlier this season I didn’t think they would hold on, but I remember how people used to say our “bubble would burst”. It never did and that stopped me from saying the same about Leicester.
Leicester fan's view: I still can't believe we've won the Premier League

Bob Wilson used that line about the bubble bursting but it wasn’t just him in fairness. Lots of people thought we would tail away. People seemed to have this impression of us as being a “ragtag and bobtail” team. We were good players and sometimes when you hear that kind of stuff it’s almost as if the manager has had his team talk written for him.
We ended up winning the league, two European Cups and the Super Cup, as well as a couple of League Cups and a 42-match unbeaten run. The other thing is that Leicester haven’t won the league at the first attempt, whereas Forest did it the year after promotion. So maybe the only time we can really compare the two sides properly will be a few years down the road if Leicester win a couple of European Cups. Only time will tell about that. But in today’s game it’s still an absolutely fantastic achievement for Leicester to win the Premier League.
I doubt there was anyone in the country – apart from the one or two people who stuck a bet on – who would have backed them at the start of the season, but it isn’t just this season they have been outstanding. It’s the last year. They were bottom of the league in April last year so if you look at their record since then it’s been phenomenal for a long time.
With Forest, you could probably understand the doubts because we had just gone up from the old Second Division. We scraped up really, in third place. Someone told me recently we had the fifth lowest points in history for a promoted side and it was only the year before that we were playing York City at Bootham Crescent. If you look at the team that day, there was Colin Barrett, Frank Clark, John McGovern, Ian Bowyer, Martin O’Neill, John O’Hare and myself in the starting line-up. That’s seven players who were winning European Cup winners’ medals a few years later. We lost 3-2 to York that day.
In Brian Clough we had a genius as our manager, of course, and we played some terrific attacking football. I’ll never forget our first match, though, at Everton. It was like the Alamo in the first 20 minutes, we just couldn’t get our breath. But then we got a goal from a corner and suddenly everything clicked. We won 3-1 and, after that, we really enjoyed ourselves.

I was on the left and we started the season with a 4-3-3 system where I wasn’t expected to get back too much while Martin O’Neill did a lot of the donkey work on the other side. Then we changed to 4-4-2 in the second half of the season. That wasn’t quite so attacking but we always managed to win. I can’t really remember any occasion when we got nervous during the run-in. Maybe that’s because we won it with four games still to play. Maybe, doing it so early, the nervousness hadn’t come in yet.
Claudio Ranieri savours Leicester glory ‘like a good wine’

Down the spine of the side we had two no-nonsense centre-halves in Larry Lloyd and Kenny Burns. The two at Leicester, Wes Morgan and Robert Huth, are no-nonsense too and we’ve seen how good they are, like we were, at keeping clean sheets.
Our defence was really strong and, behind them, we had the world’s greatest goalkeeper in Peter Shilton. Everyone has been talking about what a great player Riyad Mahrez is, and Jamie Vardy has obviously scored a lot of goals, but it’s not just two or three players who have won them the league. Danny Drinkwater’s a player. We’ve spoken about how good their defence is and my old team-mate Frank Clark is always talking about N’Golo Kanté.
I was at Leicester for four years, working with Martin O’Neill when he was manager, and we had some fantastic times. We had a really good side who finished regularly in the top 10 and we won the League Cup twice. I imagine a lot of people thought that was possibly as far as a club of Leicester’s size could reach. It’s fantastic they have shown they can go even further and you can’t really praise them enough.
