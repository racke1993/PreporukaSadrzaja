Police may go to court to ensure possible prosecution of Tories over alleged election overspending can go ahead
The Crown Prosecution Service has put out a statement about today’s meeting with the Electoral Commission. (See 10.32am.) Here it is in full.
Following a constructive meeting with the police and Electoral Commission, it has been agreed that each relevant police force will consider what action to take. This may include making an application to the court under s.176 of the Representations of the People Act 1983 to extend the time allowed to bring a prosecution.
This is significant. Here’s what it means.
Police forces may go to court to ensure time limits don’t stop possible prosecution of the Tories for breaking election expenses laws, the CPS says.

Labour’s Meg Hillier goes next.
Q: The incompetence of your government is putting the pro-Europe case at risk. Payments for farmers have not been processed properly.

Cameron says Sir Bill Cash always wanted the UK to have some sort of associate membership of the EU. But that option was not available, he says.
He says Cash argued in the 1990s that the UK opt-out on the single currency would not work. But it has worked. And the Danish opt-out worked for them.

Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, goes first.
Q: Were you serious when you suggested that you might recommend leaving the EU if you did not get your way in the renegotiation?
Cameron says he has never advocated leaving the EU.
Q: But if you had not got a renegotiation, would you be now advocating leaving?
Cameron says that is a hypothetical question. He never wanted the British people to have to answer that question.
Q: I’m trying to find out if you are recommending that Britain stays on the basis of the renegotiation.
Cameron says some people would want to leave whatever happened. He wants to stay in the EU on the basis of what he has renegotiated.
Q: If the choice was staying in the EU as it is now, what would you recommend?
Cameron says he is advising people to stay in the EU on the basis of what he has renegotiated.
He says it is “an additional reasons to stay”. It has addressed concerns people had real worries about.

Farron challenges government to take at least 1,000 child refugees
Tim Farron, the leader of the Lib Dems, has also welcomed the government’s child refugee U-turn. But he says the government will have to take at least 1,000 children to make it meaningful. In a statement he said:
Since I first raised the issue with him last October, the prime minister has done everything he can to ignore the plight of unaccompanied child refugees in Europe, so I strongly welcome the announcement that we will finally be helping these vulnerable kids.
90,000 unaccompanied children arrived in Europe last year, so 3,000 is the very least Britain can do. I will do everything I can to ensure that the government meets this target.
What started as a call supported only by the Lib Dems has developed into a truly cross party campaign, and those activists up and down the country who have championed this should be proud of their efforts today.
The detail remains to be seen. Tens or hundreds simply won’t be good enough and would be a betrayal of the British public and parliament.
This is a victory, but it’s not the end of the story. The government must also ensure that local authorities are properly funded so that they can help these traumatised children rebuild their lives and achieve their full potential.
UPDATE: In his statement Farron says fewer than 1,000 refugees “won’t be good enough” but a Lib Dem spokesman says the party actually wants the government to take 3,000.

Many of you are interested in the meeting between the Electoral Commission and the Crown Prosecution Service about extending legal time-limits to allow a possible prosecution in relation to the allegations about the Tories breaking rules on election spending. (See 10.32am.)
The meeting took place earlier. The commission aren’t saying anything about it, but the CPS say they are due to issue a statement later this afternoon. I’ll post it when I get it.

Yvette Cooper, chair of Labour’s refugee task force, has described the government child refugee U-turn (see 2.13pm) as “a major change”. In a statement she said:
Now we have seen more detail on the government’s announcement, it’s clear this is a major change in principle in the space of a week and that is huge tribute to everyone who has campaigned so hard on this.
I strongly welcome this major change in principle. Now we need to make sure it turns into practice and that enough places are provided.
For the first time, the government has accepted that Britain should do its bit and help child refugees who are at risk within Europe - having refused even a week ago to countenance this. And they are accepting the Dubs amendment that the Prime Minister rejected last week.
This has only happened because of the huge strength of feeling that Britain should help children sleeping rough, at risk of harm and prostitution, meaning ministers realised they would have lost the vote. It shows that cross party campaigning can make a real difference.
However the government hasn’t said how many children will be helped and hasn’t said whether this will be close to the 3000 places we originally called for. So we will keep up the campaign to make sure it delivers in practice.

Sadiq Khan, Labour’s candidate for London mayor, has told London Live TV that he will use his second preference vote in the mayoral contest to vote for the Women’s Equality party. He said:
I’m a big fan of the Women’s Equality party. I say this in a non-patronising way, I’ve got two daughters and what’s unacceptable in 2016 is your gender can define the job you can get, it can define how safe you are and can define the pay you get.
It will be a completely redundant vote - assuming his first vote is for himself, Khan’s second preference won’t come into play - but it is nevertheless a notable quasi-endorsement.

Nigel Farage is campaigning in Lincolshshire today. Apart from a few seats on Lincoln city council the only other election being held in the county is for the police and crome commissioner. There are serious fears that the turnout will be so low that Ukip could have their first PCC with control over the police force. Their candidate is a Victoria Ayling whose views on sending home all immigrants were too much even for the Daily Mail.
