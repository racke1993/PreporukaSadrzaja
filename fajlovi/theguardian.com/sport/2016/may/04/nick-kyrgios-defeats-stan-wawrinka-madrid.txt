Nick Kyrgios let his tennis do the talking against Stanislas Wawrinka as he knocked the fourth seed out of the Madrid Open with a scintillating display.
Last year the 20-year-old got a suspended 28-day ban and $25,000 fine (£17,000) after making lurid remarks about Wawrinka’s girlfriend during their match at the Rogers Cup in Montreal.
Kyrgios, who has had several brushes with authority, was widely criticised, but his 7-6, 7-6 second-round victory over the Swiss on Wednesday was further proof of a growing maturity after he won his first ATP title earlier this year in Marseille.
There was the odd outburst at the umpire, one after a first serve during the first-set tie-break was called out despite appearing to clip the line, but Kyrgios kept his emotions in check to edge a tight tussle.
